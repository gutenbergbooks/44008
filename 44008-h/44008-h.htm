on the<br />

Assassination of President Kennedy</h2>

<hr />
<h2 id="t1"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_EDWARD_VOEBEL" id="TESTIMONY_OF_EDWARD_VOEBEL">TESTIMONY OF EDWARD VOEBEL</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Edward Voebel was taken on April 7, 1964, at the Old Civil
Courts Building, Royal and Conti Streets, New Orleans, La., by Mr. Albert E.
Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Edward Voebel, 4916 Canal Street, New Orleans, La., after first being duly
sworn, testified as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are Edward Voebel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you live at 4916 Canal Street in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where is your place of business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. At the same place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They are both at the same place, 4916 Canal Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that's here in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you are associated in business, I believe, with your mother
and father, are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Mother, uncle, and grandmother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your mother, your uncle, and your grandmother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what is your business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Quality Florist Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your age, Mr. Voebel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I am 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You received a letter from Mr. Rankin, general counsel of the
Warren Commission, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And enclosed with the letter were a copy of Senate Joint Resolution
137, authorizing the creation of the Commission to investigate the assassination
of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Executive Order No. 11130, of President Lyndon B. Johnson
appointing that Commission and fixing its powers and duties; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And a copy of the rules and regulations under which we take
testimony before the Commission and also by way of deposition, such as this
one. You received that also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it you gather from those documents that the Commission
is enjoined to investigate all of the facts and circumstances surrounding and
bearing upon the assassination of the late President John Fitzgerald Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am Albert E. Jenner. Jr., member of the legal staff of the Commission,
and I am here with my associate, Mr. Liebeler, taking depositions here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
in New Orleans, which is the birthplace of Lee Harvey Oswald, and making inquiries
of those who in the ordinary course of their lives had some contact with
this man, and also other aspects of the assassination. Now, it is our understanding
that you did have some contact with him; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like to ask you a few questions about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you first become acquainted with Lee Harvey Oswald,
and under which circumstances? Just tell me generally how that came about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, it was at school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that Beauregard Junior High School?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know what year that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Let's see. I will have to figure that out. That was about 1954
or 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you become aware of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Going to school there. Do you want me to tell you the whole
story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, let's get in a few preliminary remarks first. I would like
to have a little background in the record before we go into that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes, sir. I don't exactly remember when I first saw him, because
I might have seen him going to school and back without knowing who
it was, but I really became acquainted with him when he had this fight with
this boy, and we took him back into the boy's restroom and tried to patch him
up a bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were there individuals involved in this fight that you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me the circumstances of that, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, the day before, maybe a couple of days before, Lee had
a fight with a couple of boys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. They were the Neumeyer boys, John and Mike.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. John and Mike?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were classmates?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes. Well, I think one of them was in the same grade as Lee.
One was older than the other one. The younger one was maybe a grade or two
below Lee, and Lee was in a fight with John, the older one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let's see if I have that straight now. Lee was in a fight with
the elder of two Neumeyer brothers; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Right. He was in a fight with John Neumeyer. The fight, I
think started on the school ground, and it sort of wandered down the street in
the direction naturally in which I was going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it a protracted fight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Protracted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; did it keep going on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes, it kept going on, across lawns and sidewalks, and people
would run them off, and they would only run to the next place, and it continued
that way from block to block, and as people would run them off of one block,
they would go on to the next.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was fisticuffs; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were they about the same age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Oswald and John?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I don't know; I guess so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How about size?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I think John was a little smaller, a little shorter than Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know what caused the fight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; I don't. I don't remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you followed this fight from place to place, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why, were you curious?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; and well, it was also on my way home, going that way.
The fight traveled my route home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, what happened as this fight progressed down the
street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, I think Oswald was getting the best of John, and the little
brother sticking by his brother, stepped in too, and then it was two against one,
so with that Oswald just seemed to give one good punch to the little brother's
jaw, and his mouth started bleeding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whose mouth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Mike Neumeyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The little boy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes, sir. Mike's mouth started bleeding, and when that happened,
the whole sympathy of the crowd turned against Oswald for some reason,
which I didn't understand, because it was two against one, and Oswald had
a right to defend himself. In a way, I felt that this boy got what he deserved,
and in fact, later on I found out that this boy that got his mouth cut had been
in the habit of biting his lip. Oswald might have hit him on the shoulder or
something, and the boy might have bit his lip, and it might have looked like
Oswald hit him in the mouth, but anyway, somebody else came out and ran everybody
off then, and the whole sympathy of the crowd was against Lee at that
time because he had punched little Mike in the mouth and made his mouth
bleed. I don't remember anything that happened after that, but I think I just
went on home and everybody went their way, and then the next day or a couple
of days later we were coming out of school in the evening, and Oswald, I think,
was a little in front of me and I was a couple of paces behind him, and I was
talking with some other people, and I didn't actually see what happened because
it all happened so quick.</p>

<p>Some big guy, probably from a high school&mdash;he looked like a tremendous
football player&mdash;punched Lee right square in the mouth, and without him really
knowing or seeing really who did it. I don't know who he was, and he ran off.
That's when we ran after Lee to see if we could help him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He just swung one lick and ran?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; that's what they call passing the post. He passed the post
on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Passed the post, what's that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. That's when somebody walks up to you and punches you. That's
what's called punching the post, and someone passed the post on Lee at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You think that might have happened because of the squabble he
had with the two Neumeyer boys a day or two before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; I think that was what brought it all about. I think this
was sort of a revenge thing on the part of the Neumeyer boys, so that's when I
felt sympathy toward Lee for something like this happening, and a couple of
other boys and I&mdash;I don't remember who they were, but they brought him back
in the restroom and tried to fix him up, and that's when our friendship, or semi-friendship,
you might say, began. We weren't really buddy-buddy, but it was
just a friendship, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do remember that you attempted to help him when he
was struck in the mouth on that occasion; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; I think he even lost a tooth from that. I think he was cut
on the lip, and a tooth was knocked out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you had a mild friendship with him from that point on,
would you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me about that. Did you get together occasionally and
share interests, and what were his interests?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I don't remember exactly what his interests were. I never
even discussed that, that I know of. I was taking music uptown&mdash;I told the
investigator that I was taking clarinet lessons at the time, but actually I was
taking piano lessons, so that part was a mistake, but I did play both of them,
but at that time I was taking piano lessons, and sometimes I would stop off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
at Lee's, and we would play darts and pool. Lee's the one who taught me
to play pool. In fact, he invited me to come and play pool with him. He lived
over the top of the pool hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you accept his invitation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; that's when we played darts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You played darts and you shot pool also; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. On Exchange Alley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exchange Alley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; or Exchange Place, whatever you call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you find him adept in playing pool?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. You see, I had never played before and he showed me the
fundamentals of the game, and after a couple of games I started beating him,
and he would say, "Beginner's luck," so I don't think he was that good, because
I am really not that good at playing pool. I mean, I don't think he was a
great pool player.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But he showed an interest in the game and some adaption to
the game at the time he was teaching you; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; he liked it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He liked to play pool?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; he seemed to like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever meet his mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I think I met her one time, and for some reason I had a picture
in my mind which was different from when I saw her in the paper after all
of this happened. I didn't recognize her. She was a lot thinner, and her
hair wasn't as gray, as I recall it, when I met her. Of course, this was about
8 years ago, but I can remember she had a black dress on, and she was sitting
down smoking a cigarette; now, maybe she wasn't smoking, but this is a
picture that comes to my mind as I recall that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you smoke?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Lee smoke?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you drink?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, I don't, really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you drink occasionally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. If it's in a party, or to be sociable I do, but I am not a drinker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How about Lee, was he a drinker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, you see, we were only at the age of about fourteen or
fifteen, and smoking and drinking just wasn't of interest to a lot of people our
age at that time. Kids did it, but I had no reason for drinking at the time,
because I mean, I was just 14 years old, and I think the legal age here is 18, so
that didn't actually enter my mind.</p>

<p>There was another thing why I sort of formed a friendship with Lee, and
that was that most of the people that went to our school used to smoke, which
I thought was a bum type nature, and Lee wasn't one of those, so he fitted
in with my character, so to speak, a little bit more than the others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right; those are the things I am interested in, what you
think of Lee's habits and personality and so forth, from the time you knew
him, and don't you worry about whether it's important or not. That's my
problem.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I'm trying to get a picture of this boy as he became a man,
and that includes what he was doing and thinking when he was 14 or 15 years
old, and as far as you are concerned, during the time you were sociable with
him and particularly what your reaction to him was. People change, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Right. Now, I want to make one thing clear. I liked Lee.
I felt that we had a lot in common at that time. Now, if I met Lee Oswald, say
a year ago, I am not saying that I would still like him, but the things I remember
about Lee when we were going to school together caused me to have this
sort of friendship for him, and I think in a way I understood him better than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
most of the other kids. He had the sort of personality that I could like. He
was the type of boy that I could like, and if he had not changed at all, I probably
still would have the same feeling for Lee Oswald, at least more so than
for the Neumeyer brothers. Of course, as you say, people do change, and I
don't know how I would have felt about Lee as we both grew older. I lost
contact with Lee years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you describe the Neumeyer brothers as roustabouts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; they were ruffians, real punk-type guys. At least, that
was my impression of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, that's what I want, your impression. Would you say there
were other boys of the type of the Neumeyer brothers at Beauregard School
while you were attending there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Oh, yes; I would say most of them seemed to be troublemakers.
In fact, it was almost impossible to go to school at that time without brushing
against somebody or getting involved in a fight sooner or later. You take
me, I am not a fighter, but I had to fight at that school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; it was almost impossible to get along with the type of characters
that were going to that school at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So this particular incident, when Lee had this fight, that in your
opinion is no indication that the boy was a rabble rouser or inclined to get
into fights; is that right? Your impression was just the opposite of that; isn't
that true?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, no; I will say this; I would back down from a fight a lot
quicker that Lee would. Now, he wouldn't start any fights, but if you wanted
to start one with him, he was going to make sure that he ended it, or you were
going to really have one, because he wasn't going to take anything from anybody.
I mean, people could call me names and I might just brush that off, but
not Lee. You couldn't do that with Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say he was unusually quick to take offense?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, I didn't know him to be that way. He could have been,
now, but I wouldn't go that strong with it. All I'm saying is that if you picked
on Lee, you had a fight on your hands. He wouldn't go out of his way to avoid it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All I'm asking you is what your impression was, and I don't
want you to speculate as to what might have been. Do you think he was a
person to take offense at anything on the spur of the minute, so to speak?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, like I said, he didn't take anything from anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this a coeducational school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. High school or junior high?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Junior high school, but it just had been changed. It was a
grammar school, and it had just been changed to a junior high, and when it
changed to a junior high, it seemed to draw a lot of bad characters. As time
went on, it might have slacked off; I don't know how it is now, but living right
near there and seeing the kids come home now very often, I think they have
gotten worse, because now they have got gang wars and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You still live close to the school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; and I know they have gang wars in this cemetery near
there, and there was this guy that I believe was pushing narcotics, pushing
dope. I tried working with the police department for a long time to get this
guy out there. I believe he was pushing dope, but it was hard to pin him
down. I worked almost 2 months with the narcotics people, but he was too
slick for us. He just disappeared. He was there for about a year, and then
he disappeared.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you familiar with the Warren Easton School?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you go to Warren Easton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; I went to Fortier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Warren Easton is a senior high school; right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it somewhere close to Beauregard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Oh, about 6 or 8 blocks away, I would say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it normal for students going to Beauregard Junior High
School to then enroll in Warren Easton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; that's normally right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's the regular progression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you know that Lee attended Warren Easton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; to tell the truth, I lost complete contact with him after I
left Beauregard. I might have seen him once or twice during that summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you a grade up on him, or were you in the same grade,
or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I don't remember. Let's see&mdash;no; I think we were in the same
grade, I think we were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you left Beauregard, where did you go to high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I went to Fortier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any reason?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, Fortier has an ROTC system.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's why you went over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. To get in the ROTC; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you a service man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In what branch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did some other boys pal around with you and Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Not that I can remember. You see, the only relationship we
had after this fight I told you about, was when I would be downtown and stop
in, and we would play pool or play darts, but I don't remember participating
in any events with Lee at school. For example, I don't remember having
played ball or anything with Lee, so probably our gym periods were different.</p>

<p>I used to go straight home after school, and I think he did too, so there was
no buddying around on either of our parts at school. I had a lot of friends
and many acquaintances, but I don't think Lee did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't think Lee did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a recollection or conception of any ridicule accorded
him when he first turned up at Beauregard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; I think there was something. Always when someone comes
in new, they are supposed to belong to something like a gang or clique, and if
you didn't, then you had to prove yourself. It's just like the old story they
tell about the Irish Channel, about how anybody new moving in there had to
prove himself or fight the leader in the community before they accepted him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me some more about the Irish Channel, and how that compares
to the Beauregard situation when you were attending there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, it may be different now, but I know in my day when you
went to Beauregard, if you didn't belong to a gang or something, you had to
prove yourself. You had to fight somebody.</p>

<p>Now, the Irish Channel is a part of town around Magazine Street, oh, maybe
the 3000 block, generally around Magazine and Louisiana Avenue, I think, in
that section, and it was pretty well known that any time a stranger or someone
new moved in the neighborhood, he had to face something like that. The whole
neighborhood had gangs, and unless he joined one of them someone would have
to fight something, and it was the same at Beauregard. Of course, it was all,
you know, children and adolescent things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it was your impression that Lee had that social force,
whatever it was; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes, sir; he met it head on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was inclined to meet it head on and not back up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Right. He wouldn't take anything. I used to try to avoid it
as much as possible, until you just couldn't avoid it any more. I think a few
of the boys at the time got a wrong impression of me. They thought I was
just a fat kid, and I wouldn't do anything, and I used to take a little pushing
around, and another thing, they would always be in gangs. Now, if you got
them alone, you could whip them, but they would hang around in bunches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
In fact, I had an incident like that happen to me over at that school where
this boy marked me out. He said he didn't like the way I looked, so he just
kept talking and trying to force me into an incident, and finally he got it.
I beat the dickens out of him, and it was after school, almost the same way this
happened to Lee.</p>

<p>Word got around at the school what I had done, and a whole gang of people
met me after school one day, but I was lucky enough to talk myself out of it.
Now, when they passed the post on Lee, he was inclined to fight back, but I had
sense enough to know that you can't fight a whole gang, so I talked myself out
of it. This gang came over to my house and piled out of automobiles and started
joshing and using all kinds of vulgar language to try to get me to come out,
and my uncle ran them off, and after that I didn't have any more trouble.
You just had to prove yourself to gain the respect of those gangs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They didn't attack you any more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say that the course of conduct of Lee Oswald was
normal, having in mind the problems he was facing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes, except that he didn't make friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; he was not inclined to make friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you don't know why he was so disinclined?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, let's just put it this way; he didn't make friends. It was
just that people and things just didn't interest him generally. He was just
living in his own world, let's say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you did have some measure of common interest that you
told me about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I guess you are trying to get at the gun. Is that what you have
in mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I am not going to say what I'm trying to get at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, I know Lee seemed to have an interest in guns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And these were regular weapons, not toys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. That's right, military weapons. My uncle started a collection
while he was in the service, and he brought back a few foreign military weapons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that World War I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. World War II.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your uncle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. That's right, my uncle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you also would say that you had an interest in guns; is
that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes, I was interested in guns. In fact, we had guns around the
house all the time. We were always interested in them, my uncle and I, and I
learned to shoot a pistol when I was about, oh, 7 years old, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Lee share your enthusiasm for collecting weapons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Oh, no; I don't think I even told Lee about how I felt about
that. I don't think Lee was interested in weapons for the same reason I was.
I mean, I like weapons because I like mechanics. I like anything you can take
apart and especially weapons, and I've always liked reading about the history
of different guns, and I have often thought about what could have happened
in a situation had they had this weapon or that weapon, you know more modern
weapons than the ones they did have. I don't think Lee was interested in
the history of any weapons. For example, he wanted a pistol, but it just
seemed like he wanted the pistol just to have one, not for any purposes of
collecting them or anything.</p>

<p>I also like sport cars. You've heard of people who like mechanics and cars.
I wanted them for a purpose, whereas Lee would be inclined to want something
just to have it, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have an interest in automobiles at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You couldn't interest him in that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; I was interested in a lot of things. I had taken music, and
I liked automobiles, and I collected weapons, just a lot of things, and Lee didn't
share any of that with me, because his interests didn't seem to run that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he interested in music?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; he wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know whether he knew how to operate an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I never had seen him drive at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever discuss the subject with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Not that I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your impression as to whether he could drive or
couldn't drive an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I don't think he could drive. The only thing I think he was
interested in besides reading, that I could gather, was one day he went fishing
and he caught a whole bunch of little fish in City Park. They were no bigger
than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Almost minnows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Right, and I think he liked to fish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he talk about fishing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, not as fishermen do, but I could tell that he enjoyed fishing,
at least that day. I do know that he did go fishing, although I don't know how
often, but I know he bought a whole rig and went fishing that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you observe as to his financial circumstances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Financial circumstances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; as to his home and his dress, and his means as to his
finances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Poor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Poor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were reasonably well fixed; isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you did notice by contrast that he was a poor boy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That made no difference to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Not a bit. That's another thing about me. It doesn't matter
whether a friend of mine has money or not. Some of my best friends are very
poor, and I also have rich friends, but that doesn't matter to me. It's just the
individual person. I don't belong to any cliques. I don't fraternize with any
type of group that bands together because of some class reason or anything like
that. I like people because of maybe an interest that is similar to mine, someone
that I have a more or less common understanding with on different subjects that
I am interested in. I don't go for these people that belong to clubs or groups
like that, because I don't have the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you get out of the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Two years ago. I just served 6 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's a sort of special program?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; 6 months in the Reserves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then you have to serve 2 weeks each year; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Right. This year we are going to meet at the Brooklyn Army
Terminal and also take in the World's Fair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me more about your association with Oswald. You say you
played darts with him and you would go to the poolroom beneath the apartment
where he lived and shoot pool with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you boys hang around the poolroom after you would shoot
pool?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; nothing like that. We would go down and play two or three
games, and then I had to go because it would be getting late in the day. You see,
that would be after my music lesson, so after a couple of games I would leave
and go on home. We didn't hang around at all. For one thing, I had so many
things to do. I had my music lessons and my schoolwork, and with my folks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
in business, I had to help them out in the shop, so my time was pretty scarce
at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Lee ever own a weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. A real one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you emphasized that word "real." Is there something there
that you want to tell me about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, he did own a plastic model of a .45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A plastic model?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; and he showed that to me. I guess you want to know now
about his plan for this robbery. Actually I wasn't too much impressed with
the whole idea at first, because I had heard so much talk about stealing and
robbing and things like that, that it really didn't bother me until he did shock
me one day when he came up with a whole plan and everything that he needed
for a burglary, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, we were over at Easton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Easton High School?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; we were over there for some program that they were putting
on for junior-high people, acquainting them with the high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that right at the time you were graduating from Beauregard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he was preparing to graduate at the same time from Beauregard;
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Wasn't there a period when he dropped out of Beauregard altogether?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or was that at Easton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't remember him being out of school entirely for about
a year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; that might have been over at Easton. It could have been
over there, but I don't remember that at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, go on with your story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, this program we had, that was a band concert, and we
were listening to the band and I think this was when he revealed the plan
for stealing this pistol from a place on Rampart Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he seek to enlist you in that plan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; not really, he just told me about it. He had observed
a pistol in this window, this show window, on Rampart Street, and his plan
was to steal it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It wasn't one of these collector's items?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; I don't think so. I can't remember the pistol, to tell you
the truth, but I don't think it was a collector's piece. It was just a weapon.
It might have been a Smith &amp; Wesson. I think it was an automatic, but I
don't remember. I really didn't pay too much attention to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You actually saw the pistol in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes. To get back to my story, it was maybe the following
week that I was up at his house, and he came out with a glasscutter and a
box with this plastic pistol in it, and I think he had a plan as to how he was
going to try to get in there and get this pistol.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean in the Rampart Street store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes. Now, I don't remember if he was planning to use this
plastic pistol in the robbery or not, or just to take it and cut the glass and
break it out, and get the pistol that way. I don't think he was really sure
even then how he wanted to do it, but finally he told me his complete plans
and how he was going to cut the glass out of the window and everything, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
I didn't know what to tell him, so he said, "Why don't you come over and
look at this pistol and tell me what kind it is, and what you think of my
plan?" So I said all right, and so we walked over there to this store and we
looked at this pistol in the window, and like I said, I don't remember what
kind it was.</p>

<p>He said, "Well, what do you think?" and I didn't know what to tell him. I
didn't know how to talk him out of it, so then I happened to notice this band
around the window, a metal tape that they use for burglar alarms, and I got to
working on that idea in the hope that I could talk him out of trying it, and
I told him, I said, "Well, I don't think that's a good idea, because if you cut
that window, it might crack that tape, and the burglar alarm will go off," and
I don't think he believed me, but I told him, "Let's go in the store and
look at it from the inside," and so I convinced him that it would be too dangerous
to try it, that this was a burglar alarm that would go off, and so anyway,
he finally gave up the idea. There had been some jewel robberies on Canal
Street and the way they were doing it was cutting a hole in the window, such
as Lee planned to do. I remember reading about that, but anyway, he finally
changed his mind about trying to rob the store, and that was the end of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What kind of glasscutter was this that he showed you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Oh, it was just a real cheap one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was a plate glass window, though, you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It never occurred to you that he couldn't cut a plate glass
window with a glass cutter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Not at that time; no. I didn't know anything about the cutting
of glass anyway. I just thought he could do it, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you hear any more about that event afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; I think it just played out. I don't think he really wanted
to go through with it, to tell you the truth. I think he was really looking
for a way out. It was just some fantastic thing he got in his mind, and
actually it never did amount to anything. I mean, it seemed to me like
he just wanted me to discourage him to the point where he could back out
of the whole thing, and he never went through with it, and I never heard
anymore about it after that. Now that I look back on it, I think maybe he
was just thinking along the lines that if he went through with it, that he would
look big among the guys, you know, but I am just speculating on that, of
course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever have any discussions with Lee about politics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I mean the politics in the pure sense.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; we didn't discuss that. We were too young, I guess, to be
interested too much in politics at that time. I have read things about Lee
having developed ideas as to Marxism and communism way back when he was a
child, but I believe that's a lot of baloney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You and he never discussed anything like that, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; I am sure he had no interest in those things at that time, at
least that I know of. Of course, we took courses like political science and
courses like that, and he might have done a lot of reading and studying along
that line at that time, but I don't even know that. I know we never discussed
anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now at this time, his two brothers, they were in the service, I believe;
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, I don't know. He never did say. I know he did have two
brothers, but I didn't know what they were doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They weren't around for any of this playing darts or playing
pool, or anything else that you and Lee participated in, were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No, I never saw them. I never met them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you form an opinion as to the relationship between Lee and
his mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, I know it wasn't the type of relationship that you usually
see between a mother and her children. I'm just giving you my opinion on that,
now. I know that they weren't very close, as far as Lee was concerned, but of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
course she was always around, and I think she tried to take good care of him,
but it was hard with a person like Lee to know what he was thinking or doing
all the time.</p>

<p>I think Lee loved his mother and was concerned about her, but there was
something lacking there that you usually see between a mother and her children,
as far as I am concerned, but with the type man Lee was, I guess a lot of that
is understandable. You just couldn't get through to him. He just wasn't communicative.
He just didn't talk too much about anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he curt as to his mother, that you observed? I mean, did
he cut her off short in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, I noticed the normal resentment going on in him at that
time, but I was the same way, and I remember seeing that in other kids at that
time. Your mother might be telling you things that are normally good for you,
but I think every child resents discipline to a certain extent. I know I did at
that time, but as to Lee and his mother, I don't think there was anything violent
between them, if you know what I mean but at the same time he wasn't what
you would call a mamma's boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you mean by that expression, "mamma's boy"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, that's just an expression that was used at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it used with respect to Lee and his mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; never. He was no mamma's boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, did you have the impression that his mother was often
indulgent toward him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. In one way; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In which way was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, if he wanted something, no matter what it was, she would
always seem willing to go out of her way to get it for him. Even if she couldn't
afford it, she would try to get it for him. Of course, if there was something he
wanted and she didn't think it was good for him, I don't know about that; I
don't have any recollection of anything like that, but I know she did everything
she could for Lee, and maybe he didn't always show his appreciation the way
other kids would, but that's just the way he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What sort of impression did you have of Lee's attitude as to his
lot in life, in other words, whether he felt that since his father died so young,
and he had, I mean Lee, had received a bad deal in life. What was his attitude
about that, if any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, I think he was impressed with the fact that his father had
died at a young age, and that he never got to know his father. I think that left
a mark on him, but I don't think that's unusual in itself. I think there were
times when you could see he felt bad because he didn't have a father, but he
never actually talked about that. Lee didn't talk too much, even when we were
at Beauregard together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Lee ever come over to your house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I don't think so; no; he never did. Now, I can't say for sure,
but I don't think he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you boys ever have any common athletic interest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you active in sports?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Just in intramurals.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he play any intramurals?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I don't know. I wasn't in the same gym class with him, so I
can't say for certain on that. I don't know. He must have. I think everybody
had to play some intramural sports.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any impression as to whether he had a feeling that
there were things that should have been accorded him by way of possession or
attainment of worldly goods, of which he had been deprived because his father
had predeceased him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Did he have a feeling of that at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. You see, he was 14 years old, and I just don't think those thoughts
would have occurred to him at such a young age, any more than it would have to
me. We were just boys, and we were having a fairly good time, as all boys our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
age seemed to do. We would play darts and play pool, and do things like that
which didn't cost a lot or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I mean, did he say anything that would have given you that
impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. In fact, I am afraid that some of these impressions that I am
giving you may have been developed later, since this assassination occurred. I
don't mean that I had all of these impressions back when we were in Beauregard
together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I understand that, but the Commission is interested in the impression
you had then of Lee and the impressions you have now as compared to
then. We are trying to get the complete background of this man in order to
possibly arrive at the motive for this entire tragedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. It's hard to get what I was thinking of then, and how I think
now and separate the two; that's what I mean, because, of course, at that time
nothing like this had happened, and I didn't have in mind trying to analyze Lee's
personality or anything. You just don't go out looking for something like that
unless you have a reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You heard the rumor, or read about them at any rate, that Lee
Oswald was studying communism when he was 14 years of age, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see any evidence of that when you were going around
and associating with Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you put any credence in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; none whatever. As far as I know, I was the only one that
would enter his home, around that age, so I would be the only one to know, and
I can say for certain that the only things Lee would be reading when I would be at
his home would be comic books and the normal things that kids read.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you a voracious reader in those days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you say as to Lee Oswald, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I really can't say for sure, but he did impress me, in the time that
I knew him and associated with him, that he wasn't a great reader. We liked
to fool around more than we liked to go to school, I guess you would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You would not consider that Lee was a good reader?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; I wouldn't. I know my studies always came hard to me, even
music when I first started with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you still interested in music?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; I still play music.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say, in looking back to your acquaintance with Lee,
that he had a normal curiosity about things, the normal curiosity of a young
man of 13, 14, 15, or 16 years old?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I would say that he had a normal curiosity, if I understand then
what you mean by that. It's just that he didn't seem to be able to mix with
people; that's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you think that's a basic personality characteristic that has
remained in your mind all these years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Right. It seems to me like he did like things and wanted to do
things, but he just couldn't get himself to get with people, you see, and you just
can't do too much by yourself. To me, I think that maybe his whole downfall
was maybe a lack of communication with people. Of course, I don't know the
reason. I am not a psychologist. I can't tell you why, but somehow I have that
feeling because I knew Lee, and I knew how he didn't like to mix with people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I gather from this discussion with you that, up until this horrible
tragedy happened, you had at least a favorable impression of Lee, and even
though your opinion of his personality and attitude and behavior might have
changed since you learned of this tragedy and since his death, you at least, up
until that time, had a good opinion of him; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You think he was a normal boy, at least in most respects, and
he was not what we have referred to as a roustabout or a member of a gang at
school, or anything like that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. While you were going to Beauregard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But he did have trouble making friends at Beauregard; right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, to tell you the truth, Lee didn't go out and look for friends.
He didn't seem to care about having friends. He had a few friends, but I think
that was the way he wanted it. At least, that seems to be the way he was best
able to cope with things, to just more or less be by himself and go and come as
he wanted to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you don't think Lee was an outstanding student in his
studies at Beauregard? You think he was more or less average; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; he was just an average student.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How was his attendance at school? Did he miss many days; do
you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; I don't think he missed much schooling. I think his attendance
was pretty good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you boys ever discuss the Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; I was not much on the Marines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, my question was did you talk about this subject with Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; we didn't discuss that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever talk about his brothers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No. I think that he mentioned he had one or two, but there
was never any talk about them. I don't know anything about his brothers&mdash;I
mean what they do, how they are, and what their life is. I have no impression
of that whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever have the impression that he probably received his
just dues in the world up to that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I think I made a statement to that effect, but I can't really say
for sure. Maybe it was later that I got that impression. That's hard to pinpoint
right now, in looking back at all this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But did you have such an impression at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; I had no impression like that at that time. Like I said,
I wasn't looking for stuff like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, sometimes you don't look for that sort of thing because
you have a previous impression; isn't that true?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; that's true, but I don't think I had that impression at that
time. I'll say this: most of the things about Lee I liked. I think I might have
made a statement like that, about him being bitter toward the world and
everything, but of course, that would have been my opinion since this happened.
I wasn't talking then about when we were going to Beauregard, to
the same school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember making a statement to the FBI that in your
opinion Oswald was bitter since his father died when he was very young, and
that he thought that he had had a raw deal out of life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you still carry that opinion, and hold it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Like I say now, I think this opinion was formed later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you don't think you had those impressions then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; I didn't; not back in those days. I formed that later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was that embitterment directed toward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Toward authority, I would say. He didn't like authority.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You noticed that at that time, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I think so. He didn't seem to like to be told what to do, or made
to do something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there a Civil Air Patrol unit here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; I think they have two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were there two here at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you and Lee have any interest in the Civil Air Patrol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; I think I got him interested in it. We got to talking about
it and I told him as much as I knew about it, and I think he attended maybe
one or two meetings, and I think he even subsequently bought a uniform, and
he attended at least one meeting that I remember, in that uniform, but after
that he didn't show up again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He just attended two meetings of the CAP?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Two or three meetings, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that's all he attended?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes. He lost interest after that, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who was the majordomo of the CAP unit that you attended?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I think it was Captain Ferrie. I think he was there when Lee
attended one of these meetings, but I'm not sure of that. Now that I think of
it, I don't think Captain Ferrie was there at that time, but he might have
been. That isn't too clear to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lee did buy a uniform to attend these CAP meetings and join
the unit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; he bought a uniform and everything, and he seemed to be
very interested at the outset. He even got a paper route, I think it was, or
something, to get enough money together to buy the uniform; he was that
interested, and that's why I thought it strange when he didn't attend any more
meetings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You thought that was strange?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes. After all this happened, and, of course, this is my opinion
now, I guess&mdash;not then, but I think now maybe he liked the uniform to wear
more than he did like going to the school, with those classes that we had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had classes at these meetings of the CAP unit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Oh, yes; we had classes, and maybe that was the thing that Lee
didn't care for, because after those couple of meetings he just didn't show
up any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did these classes at the CAP unit that you attended require
some study?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Lee ever talk to you about himself and his history, of his
earlier life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. His "history"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; his background&mdash;anything about his family before he ever
met you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, he mentioned the fact about his father dying, but he didn't
talk about much else; I mean about when he was younger, or anything like that.
Maybe he might have mentioned about coming here from Texas, and things like
that, you know, at different times, but I don't recall all of that now. I got the
impression somewhere that he wasn't born here, and I got the impression that
he was from Texas at that time, but, of course, that wasn't correct, as I learned
after all this happened. But, I mean, we didn't sit around talking about things
like that. We were more interested, I guess, in things at school and things
that were going around, more up to date, I guess you would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he talk to you at all about his life in Texas, or to anyone in
your presence, that you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No. I mean, he might have mentioned it at different times, just
as a passing remark, or something. You know how that is, but if he did it has
just slipped my mind, because it wasn't anything that would impress me so
that I would remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you attend these CAP meetings once a week or twice a
week, or how often?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Twice a week, and now that I think of it, Lee might have actually
attended two or three meetings. It seems like he maybe attended two
or three of them, but anyway he quit then, all of a sudden. He just quit coming,
so I figured he had lost interest in the whole thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any idea what made him quit attending those
classes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, as I remember, we were having classes then on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
weather, and that can be a drab subject, although it is essential, but maybe
that's why he quit coming; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this CAP unit coeducational?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Because sometimes that can stimulate your interest too, isn't
that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, to tell you the truth, no. I had no girl friend out there
at that time. I had a girl at the school, but that was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But there were girls out at this unit, attending these classes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes; but they were kept pretty well separated from us. They
might have been in the classes, but the girls out there didn't interest me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they interest Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; I don't think so. He wasn't very interested in girls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No. At least it didn't impress me that he was. He didn't show
any inclination toward girls at all, that I could see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he have any sex deviation of any kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. None whatever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From your experience, he seemed to be perfectly normal in that
respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He might have been interested in girls, but he just wasn't pushing
it at that time if he was, is that about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. I think he was more bashful about girls than anything else. I
think that was probably it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there anything that you can think of from your acquaintance
with Lee, from what you knew about him then, that you could tell us that
would be helpful to the Commission, aside from what I have asked you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. No; I can't think of anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, in taking these depositions, you have the privilege of
reading and signing your deposition, or you can waive that privilege and let
the reporter transcribe the deposition, and it will be sent on to Washington.
However, if you want to read and sign it, it will be transcribed, and the U.S.
attorney will contact you and let you know when you may come in and read
and sign it. What is your preference in that regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Well, I don't have to read it and sign it. I have just told you
what I know about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You prefer to waive that then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voebel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Thank you for coming in.</p>

<h2 id="t15"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_WILLIAM_E_WULF" id="TESTIMONY_OF_WILLIAM_E_WULF">TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM E. WULF</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of William E. Wulf was taken on April 7&ndash;8, 1964, at the Old
Civil Courts Building, Royal and Conti Streets, New Orleans, La., by Mr. Wesley
J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">William B. Wulf, having been first duly sworn, was examined and testified
as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Wulf, my name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am a member of
the legal staff of the President's Commission investigating the assassination of
President Kennedy. Staff members have been authorized to take the testimony
of witnesses by the Commission pursuant to authority granted to the Commission
by Executive Order No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution
of Congress No. 137.</p>

<p>I understand that Mr. Rankin wrote to you last <span class="locked">week&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Advising you that I would be in touch with <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. With respect to the taking of your testimony, and I understand
that he enclosed with his letter copies of the Executive order and the joint
resolution to which I have just referred, as well as a copy of the rules of
procedure relating to the taking of testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did receive the letter, et cetera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We want to inquire of you concerning possible knowledge that
you have of Lee Harvey Oswald during the time that he lived in New Orleans
during the period 1954&ndash;55. Before we get into the details of that, however,
would you state your full name for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. My name is William Eugene Wulf. No junior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. 2107 Annunciation Street, this city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where and when were you born, Mr. Wulf?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. I was born in New Orleans, September 22, 1939.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you presently employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. No. I am a student at Louisiana State University at New
Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What are you majoring in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. History.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long have you been attending LSU?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Four and a half years. I am a senior at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You obtained your primary education and secondary education
here in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you obtain that education, what schools?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. My primary education was obtained, up until the seventh grade,
at Redemptorist Grammar School. For high school I attended De La Salle
High School in 1956, and in 1958 and 1959 I attended Cor Jesu High School in
New Orleans and graduated there in 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And then from there you went to LSU?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. LSU, right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you been in the Army or any branch of the military
service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. No. I am exempted at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Commission has received information to the effect that you
were the President of the New Orleans Amateur Astronomy <span class="locked">Association&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Sometime during the year 1955. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is the New Orleans Amateur Astronomy Association, or
what was it at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. It was at that time an organization of mainly high school students
in the city, mainly at De La Salle at that time, interested in astronomy, who
owned telescopes, did observation, etc.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is the group still active?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. No. We are still listed as active in the membership rolls of the
national association, but we are not active due to the fact that most of the
members are out of town, either in the military or in college.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In connection with your activities in the New Orleans Amateur
Astronomy Association, did there ever come a time when you were contacted
by or met a person who you either now believe or know to be Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. I believe it was. The one person who could have confirmed this
in my behalf was Mr. McBride, P.&nbsp;E. McBride, who is in Florida at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is Palmer McBride?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Right. But I had met Oswald through McBride. He contacted
me on getting into the Astronomy Club at that time, and it was&mdash;I had originally
believed it was 1953, but on recapitulating the time and all, probably it
was September or August in 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember how Oswald got in touch with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Not exactly. It was either one of two ways. I believe he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
talked to McBride or McBride had talked to him during the time they were
working together at Pfisterer's Dental Laboratory, and I believe he got in touch
with me on the telephone about getting into the group and I told him&mdash;he asked
me could he come over to the house one time, and I believe he soon did. I don't
remember the time that elapsed between what I believe was the phone call and
then the actual visit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This fellow that called you and then came over to your house
did work at Pfisterer's Dental Laboratory? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Most definitely; yes. That is what gave me reason to associate
Oswald with this particular person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This association was made by you at some time subsequent
to the assassination. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Yes; subsequent. I believe it was either the Saturday night following
the assassination or Sunday morning before I got the call from the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You had read in the paper that Lee Oswald had been employed
while living here in New Orleans by Pfisterer's Dental Laboratory, and then
you associated <span class="locked">Oswald&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. No; not actually. I had remembered he had lived in New Orleans,
and then I tended to associate the name too and the picture, and then I subsequently
found out&mdash;I confirmed it when I asked the FBI agent did this particular
person at one time work for Pfisterer's, and he said he believed he did, and
that to me confirmed it was the same person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you had already associated in your mind the name Lee
Oswald with this fellow that called you, and also the pictures that you saw
in the paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And then as a result of that association, you asked the FBI
whether this man had been employed by Pfisterer's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. That is correct. One other thing made me come to the association,
other than&mdash;I must stipulate at this time that when I had met him he spoke
of communism and communistic association that he would like to achieve, and
this also aided in this conclusion that I came to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now how did it come to be, if you know, that the FBI interviewed
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did not contact the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. No; I did not, because I was not absolutely sure, and it was a
Sunday, either a Saturday night or Sunday, and during the chaos on the situation,
and I believe I was personally affected by it as everyone else was personally
affected by it, and I really did not think that the little knowledge I had would
be important. I was even surprised that I got your letter from the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The agent that interviewed you didn't indicate in any way as
to how they had been led to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. In no way whatsoever. As far as I know, the only person that
knew that I had met Oswald, and that it was Oswald, was Palmer McBride,
so I concluded that he probably got in touch with the FBI on the subject, or
someone got in touch with them, and then that is how they got this particular
knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you first make McBride's acquaintance? Do you
remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Yes. I will have to clarify that. I can get the records from the
Astronomy Club, but I believe it was 1954&mdash;that is a rough date&mdash;probably
towards the end, probably&mdash;let's see&mdash;I am trying to associate it with the
Astronomy Club dates&mdash;towards the end of the school year 1954&ndash;55, so that
would probably be in&mdash;oh, March and April, around that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Of 1955?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Of 1955, yes. It is sketchy. I really cannot say for sure. I could
probably get it from the Astronomy Club's records, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The occasion of your first meeting was that he came to join
the Astronomy <span class="locked">Association&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. With McBride. Did become closely acquainted with McBride
and become a friend of his after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Oh, yes. I still, up until about 9 months ago kept in contact with
him, and I still know of his whereabouts, and when he comes to the city I still
see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. McBride at that time was working at Pfisterer's Dental Laboratory?
Is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Yes, sir. I believe he was a delivery boy or a runner. I don't know
the exact title of his position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you ever spoken with McBride about Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Only at the time that&mdash;two occasions or possibly three&mdash;I think it
was two occasions that I met Oswald, and I got some of Oswald's beliefs, and I
told&mdash;McBride had always told me that he wanted to get into the military
service as a career, especially rocket engineering and rocketry&mdash;like we all were
nuts on rocketry at the time&mdash;and I told him, I said, "This boy Oswald, if you
associated with him, could be construed as a security risk, and especially if you
want to get into a job position where the information you know could be of a
security nature or of a type that could be of a security risk nature."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You told that to McBride some time back in 1955? Is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What led you to make that statement to McBride?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. I made that statement to McBride after my second meeting with
Oswald when we got into a discussion&mdash;I being a history major and always
been interested in history, some way or another we got around to communism.
I think Oswald brought it up, because he was reading some of my books in my
library, and he started expounding the Communist doctrine and saying that he
was highly interested in communism, that communism was the only way of
life for the worker, et cetera, and then came out with the statement that he
was looking for a Communist cell in town to join but he couldn't find any. He
was a little dismayed at this, and he said that he couldn't find any that would
show any interest in him as a Communist, and subsequently, after this conversation,
my father came in and we were kind of arguing back and forth
about the situation, and my father came in the room, heard what we were
arguing on communism, and that this boy was loud-mouthed, boisterous, and
my father asked him to leave the house and politely put him out of the house,
and that is the last I have seen or spoken with Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now you indicated that your argument was rather loud and
boisterous?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald generally impress you as a loud or boisterous
person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Well, he impressed me as a boy who could get violent over communism,
who, if you did not agree with his belief, he would argue with you
violently over it. This, as you know, was the period right before he moved, I
believe, to Dallas. I did hear that he had moved to Dallas. I got that from
McBride. And he struck me as a very boisterous boy and very determined in
his way about communism.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he strike you as boisterous in any other respect, or strongheaded
about other things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Generally a strongheaded boy that knew his own mind, thought
he knew his own mind, and would do his own will. He wanted his way, in
other words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Then there never was any question of <span class="locked">physical&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Contact over this thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It was just a strongly presented argument?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. No. My father just took him by the arm, and when he started
hollering about communism and all, and my father had gone through Communist
affairs in Germany in the 1920's, and did not agree with him violently,
and he asked him to leave the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is your father a native of Germany?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Hamburg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And he had been involved in some political activities with or
opposed to the Communists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Not that I know of. What I mean, he came back from Germany
following the war, 1919&ndash;20, when it was all upheaval. The Democratic Party
was fighting the Communist wing and all. He remembered that and he just&mdash;well,
as most Germans, a lot of Germans, do, they just don't like Communists.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember anything about the details of your first
meeting with Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Very little. If I remember correctly, the main thing was that he
asked&mdash;we talked about astronomy, and I drew from that, from the conversation,
that he knew very little about astronomy, and it struck me that he wanted
to join the group, because I expressed to him at the time that anyone with a
little knowledge of astronomy was hampered in the group and mostly everybody
in the group knew astronomy and we were not very much interested in teaching
some fledgling all this data we had already gone through over the years, and
he would actually be hampered in belonging to the group, and I actually discouraged
him from joining the group for that reason. That is all I can remember
of the first contact, because it was kind of late, it was probably 2 or 3 o'clock
in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was at a meeting of the association?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. No; this was at my home. McBride had brought him to my house.
It must have been 10 o'clock at night or 11 o'clock at night, something like that,
and we got into a conversation on astronomy in general and just a general
topical conversation as far as I can remember. It is somewhat hard to remember,
you know, after all these years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There wasn't any discussion of politics or economics at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Not at that time; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now can you remember anything else about the second meeting
with Lee Oswald that you haven't already told us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Not specifically. All I can repeat is that we discussed communism
in general and that Oswald showed himself to be a self-made Communist.
I don't think anybody got to him, if you want to put it that way. He just
learned it on his own. At that time I knew very little about communism, and
he was just&mdash;actually militant on the idea, and I can repeat he expressed his
belief that he could be a good Communist, he could help the Communist Party
out, if he could find the Communist Party to join it, and at that time he expressed
that he couldn't <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate in any way that he had actually tried to find a
Communist organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Definitely. That is one thing that made me associate the name
Oswald with this particular person, that he definitely was looking for a Communist
Party to join and he was very disgusted because he <span class="locked">couldn't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Couldn't find one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether Oswald ever discussed matters such as
this with McBride?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Now this would be hearsay. Yes; I believe he had. McBride and
I had discussed Oswald a few times between the second visit when we threw
him out of the house or asked him to leave and his subsequent leaving for
Dallas. I continually tried to get McBride to stop associating with Oswald,
and he did actually, as far as I know, except for, you know, working hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And McBride told you that Oswald had also discussed communism
with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Oh, yes, yes; that he discussed it constantly when they were on the
job and, you know, delivering dentures, and in their social association. It
might be of importance to point out that both boys struck me as lonely boys.
McBride was working at that time, he had quit school and was working and
going to a correspondence school, and I think they tended to associate because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
of that reason, because they were just plain lonely, not knowing too many people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was true, in your opinion, both of Oswald and McBride?
Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. On this particular point, yes; that they were both&mdash;well, for one
thing, I think that would lead a boy to get the type of job that they held at the
time. I think most of the boys who held that job were that type of boy who
were fighting education, except for McBride&mdash;he wasn't fighting education, because
he was fighting the need for more money. You know, a young boy like
that, his family was quite large and not of very great income, and I think this
made Oswald and McBride associate probably with each other, but I do know that
he told me after this second visit that&mdash;we discussed Oswald, and I discussed
Oswald specifically as a security risk. The reason why I was knowledgeable
on this was that my father was in the Merchant Marine and on a Navy Reserve
ship that did require some security clearance, and I was quite conscious of it,
and also during the war, because we were German and I was quite conscious
of security matters and all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether McBride ever expressed any interest in
communism or ever expressed any interest in Communist organizations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Not really; no, no. As far as I know, definitely not. He was
strong-willed, but never, as far as I know, ever expressed really any belief in
communism.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. (Exhibiting photograph to witness) I want to show you two
pictures which have previously been marked "Pizzo Exhibits 453-A and 453-B."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I ask you if you recognize any of the individuals in those
pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Well, yes; Oswald marked "1" on the top picture, "Pizzo 453-B,"
and, of course, Oswald again marked with the "X" in green on "Pizzo 453-A."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You recognize that as Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Yes. That is one of the things. I saw these films on TV and
I subsequently saw them at the station. That is Oswald, as far as I can
associate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you say "these films," you are inferring that these pictures
that I have shown you are still photos taken out <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Yes. These are 16 mm. prints&mdash;I can tell by the grain&mdash;and
they are either 16 mm. or 32 mm., probably 16 mm. prints, and these are the
ones, as far as I know, that WDSU had. I don't believe that is what you want
though. That is the only one I can associate on there. I do not associate the
other man <span class="locked">marked&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you identify this man as Oswald based on your observation
of him at the times you have mentioned, and not from having seen his pictures
at other places in the newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. No; I base that picture on&mdash;when I first saw those films originally,
when it was originally shown on TV, I had a slight inkling that it was the
same person, as far as I know. I mean, like I said, it was many years ago, it
was&mdash;oh, 8 years ago, 8 or 9 years ago. He was younger, he was a little bit
heavier then, in the face especially, but he seems to me to be the same person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that identification on your part is reinforced by the logical
steps <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Right, the logical association. Yes; I admit this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that logical association is the association that we have
already described throughout this record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Right, right; and also the time factor when he was in New
Orleans, the association with Pfisterer's Laboratory, and that I know for a
fact that in October of that year or early in the winter of that year that he did
move to Dallas, because McBride told me that his mother and he had moved
to Dallas. Also I knew a little bit about him. McBride had discussed with
me a little of his family situation. I had asked him about it because of his
attitudes and such.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How do you mean "his family situation"? You mean his
mother?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Yes; I asked McBride specifically how come this boy was like
this, mixed up and all, and he said he lived with his mother&mdash;this is hearsay,
of course, through McBride&mdash;that his mother didn't associate with him too
much and the boy was pretty much on his own and a loner as such.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And this was a discussion that you had with McBride in
1955&ndash;56?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Right, 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you talked to McBride about this thing since the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. No, I have not. I have only corresponded with McBride once,
and that was about a month ago. I sent him an amateur radiogram requesting
the address of a mutual friend in New York, but I got no answer, and we were
wondering where he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I can't think of any other questions at this point. If you can
think of anything else that you know about that you would like to add or that
you think would be helpful to the Commission, I would appreciate it if you
would add it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. Not that I know of. The only thing I can&mdash;I don't know how
many people have told you of this period of his life&mdash;I amplify that at this
time Oswald was definitely Communist-minded, he was violently for communism,
and this is what struck me as so odd for a boy so young at the time.
I believe we were both 16, and he was quite violent for communism. His
beliefs seemed to be warped but strong, and one thing that did hit me, he
seemed&mdash;I told this to McBride at the time&mdash;he seemed to me a boy that was
looking for something to belong to. I don't think anybody was looking for
him to belong to them, and it may have been a problem, but he was definitely
looking for something to associate himself with. He had very little self-identification,
and at the time he hit me as somebody who was looking for identification,
and he just happened, I guess, to latch on to this particular area to become
identified with. That is about all I know of him at that time, and following
that period, after he moved from New Orleans and went to Dallas, I knew
nothing of him until I saw what I thought was him at the time, but I was not
sure, the films that you showed me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't have any other questions at this point. I want to
thank you very much for coming in and cooperating with us to the extent that
you have. The Commission appreciates it very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wulf</span>. That is quite all right. I am glad we could help.</p>

<h2 id="t21"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_MRS_BENNIERITA_SMITH" id="TESTIMONY_OF_MRS_BENNIERITA_SMITH">TESTIMONY OF MRS. BENNIERITA SMITH</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Mrs. Bennierita Smith was taken on April 7&ndash;8, 1964, at the Old
Civil Courts Building, Royal and Conti Streets, New Orleans, La., by Mr. Wesley
J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mrs. Bennierita Smith, having been first duly sworn, was examined and
testified as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mrs. Smith, my name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am a member
of the legal staff of the President's Commission investigating the assassination
of President Kennedy. Staff members have been authorized to take the testimony
of witnesses by the Commission pursuant to the authority granted to the
Commission by Executive Order No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and Joint
Resolution of Congress No. 137.</p>

<p>I understand that Mr. Rankin wrote to you last week indicating that I would
be in touch with you concerning your testimony.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that he enclosed with his letter a copy of the Executive
order and of the resolution to which I have just referred, as well as a copy
of the rules of procedure adopted by the Commission concerning the taking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
testimony of witnesses. Did you receive Mr. Rankin's letter and those documents?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. One of the areas of inquiry of the Commission relates to the
background and possible motive of Lee Harvey Oswald, the alleged assassin of
the President. We understand that you knew Lee Oswald at some point while
he was living here in New Orleans. Before we get into the details of that,
however, I would like to have you state your name for the record, if you will.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Bennierita Smith.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are married? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was your name before you were married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Sparacio. My maiden name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Sparacio, S-p-a-r-a-c-i-o.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. 3522 Delambert in Chalmette.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where and when were you born?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I was born in New Orleans the 20th of January 1940.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you outline for us your educational background, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Starting from kindergarten?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, I went to St. Dominic's. That is on Harrison Avenue in
Lakeview. Then I went&mdash;it was either the third or fourth grade I transferred
to Lakeview School, and then when I finished Lakeview School I went on to
Beauregard, and from there to Warren Easton, and that is all the schooling I
have had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you graduate from Warren Easton High School?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you graduate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Am I correct in understanding that you attended Beauregard
Junior High School at the same time that Lee Oswald did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know Lee Oswald at the time you both attended
Beauregard Junior High School?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, I knew him from seeing him walk around school, and well,
I guess I could remember him so much because he was always getting in fights
with people, but as far as really knowing him well outside of school, you know,
seeing him, I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, now you mentioned that he was always getting in fights?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Will you tell us what you know about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. One fight really impressed me, I guess because there was this
boy&mdash;he wasn't going to Beauregard, this boy he had the fight with, and he was
a little guy. I think his name was Robin Riley. He hit Lee, and his tooth came
through his lip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Through the upper part of his lip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Oh, gee, I don't know whether it was a <span class="locked">bottom&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But it actually tore the lip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; it actually tore the lip, and I remember&mdash;what is that boy's
name?&mdash;the blond fellow that was on television that knew him so well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you thinking of Edward Voebel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That is him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. V-o-e-b-e-l?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. He took him back in school, and I guess they kind of patched
his lip up, but he was&mdash;he more or less kept to himself, he didn't mix with
the other kids in school other than Voebel. He is the only one I remember.
And they had this little boy&mdash;I think it was Bobby Newman&mdash;he used to take
around with, but I don't remember too much about him either. I can remember
he was little, he was short.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who was?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Bobby Newman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Bobby Newman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. But he was, I guess, the studious type. Well, it seemed to me.
He was always studying, you know, reading books, and that is as far as&mdash;I don't
know what his grades were, but as far as him mixing with other people, he
didn't. You know, like when you go to school, more or less everybody has their
own group. Well, there wasn't anybody he hung around with, except, like I said,
Edward Voebel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How well do you know Mr. Voebel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Not well at all, I mean just from seeing him in school. I knew
his parents had owned the Quality Florists on Canal Street. Well, I knew his
sisters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You knew Voebel's sister?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; he has got two, they are twins, Doris&mdash;and they call the
other one Teddy. I don't know what her real name was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear what this fight was all about, the one you
described in which Oswald had his lip cut?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No; I really didn't. I just saw people standing around and knew
there was a fight, and, you know, went over to see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you get the impression that Oswald started the fight or
that the other guy started the fight?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I really don't know. I didn't know what happened. Well, I
know this boy was, I guess, a kind of a smart alec, this guy he had the fight with,
this Robin Riley. Well, he was always hanging around school but he didn't
go there, you know, he <span class="locked">just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was this Riley boy older, do you know, or about the same age
as the rest of the students?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I think he was older, because he had a sister that went to Warren
Easton with me and she was older, she was a grade ahead of me, and I am
almost sure he was older than her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This fellow didn't go to Beauregard Junior High School?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know if he went to school somewhere else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No; I sure don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that the only fight that you can recall in which Oswald was
involved?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see the television program that was played over WDSU
shortly after the assassination in which Voebel appeared?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; I did see that. Larry Lala and Bob Jones had come to my
house. Well, I knew Larry. He knew I went to Beauregard, and he called me
up and asked me if I had remembered Lee Oswald, and when I thought about
him, you know, things started coming back. It had been such a long time. And
he asked me if they could come over, that they were writing this story on him,
and I told him to come over if he wanted but I didn't think I could really help
him, because it wasn't anything I knew about him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This person that called you was a newspaper reporter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, he works for WWL. He takes the news films for them.
And when he came in the house, I thought he would come with a pad and pencil,
and he walks in with cameras and lights. He picked up one of my girl friends,
he brought her over, and this other girl I went to school with, she was at my
house, she had spent the day with me. It just so happened she was there. And
then they just asked us questions, but I told Larry about that fight. Well, he
had remembered the same incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you appear in the television program?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir; the three of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Three of you would be yourself&mdash;and what were the names of
the other two girls?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Anna Alexander Langlois and Peggy Murphy Zimmerman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now these two boys that you mentioned were classmates of
yours at Beauregard Junior High School? Is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Larry and Bob?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No; Larry&mdash;I met Larry&mdash;gee, I don't even remember&mdash;I guess
maybe at a school dance or something&mdash;and I went out with him, and he knew
I went to Beauregard, you see. That is why he called me to see if I had remembered
Lee, because I guess they were trying to get some&mdash;well, more or
less a story together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What about the other boy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Bob Jones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, he broadcasts the news.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He works for the television station?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. And he just came. Well, he asked us questions and then we
just answered him, but I didn't know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember what you told him at that time? You mentioned
this fight to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I mentioned that, and then he just asked us how well we knew
him, and we told him we didn't really know him as far as&mdash;like we would know
him from seeing him walk through the halls at school or in class, but as far
as knowing him outside of school, well, we didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know where he lived?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No; I didn't, not until, well, I read it in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did your other two girl friends remember any more details about
Lee Oswald than you did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No. Bob asked us how he dressed, and we told him, you know,
that he always wore these sweater vests&mdash;they are more or less in style now,
I guess, than they were when we were going to school&mdash;it was just like wearing
your father's sweater or something, but, you know, maybe he was outstanding in
that way. But that is all we told him. My girl friend told him about that,
and&mdash;I am trying to remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember that Lee wore the sweater vests, or was that
something that one of your girl friends remembered?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, she mentioned it, and then, well, we did remember him
dressing that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Which one of your girl friends was it mentioned this first?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I think it was Peggy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Peggy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Peggy Zimmerman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there anything else that the three of you were able to
recall about Lee Oswald, either at the time you were questioned by the television
people or after that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was this the only fight, the one we talked about? Was this
the only fight that any of you had ever remembered Lee Oswald being involved
in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That is the only one I remembered. Somebody had said he was
in a fight with Johnny Neumeyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that one of your girl friends who mentioned that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I am not sure if it was them or if it was Anna's brother who told
her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember whether Lee Oswald dated any girls at the
time he went to Beauregard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Not that I know of, not in school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It was your impression that Lee Oswald didn't have any close
associates or close friends while he was at Beauregard, with the possible exception
of Mr. Voebel? Is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now aside from your recollection about Lee's wearing a
sweater vest, can you remember anything else about the way he dressed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. He wore levis, I think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that different from what the other students wore?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes. Well, they more or less wore slacks, you know, pants or
khakis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was Lee ever criticized or given a hard time because of the
way he dressed or the way <span class="locked">he&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No; not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember that Lee was ever bullied or pushed around
by the other boys for any reason?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No; not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There isn't anything that stands out in your mind about Lee
Oswald that really would set him apart from the other students, is there, <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, I can just remember him walking, like down the hall in
school, and he would just walk like he was proud, you know, just show his back
and&mdash;but there isn't anything other than that fight. I think that is what made
me remember him the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether people thought that he was peculiar or
arrogant because of this way in which he carried himself and the way in which
he walked?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No. He never did mingle with anyone, you know. I guess they
just more or less left him alone, unless if he ever started a fight with them
<span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear of Lee starting a fight with anybody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know how this <span class="locked">fight&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I don't know how this fight started, I really don't. Like I say,
I saw a group of people standing around, and when I went to see, they were
fighting, but I <span class="locked">really&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you talked to Voebel at all about this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; I haven't seen him&mdash;gee, I guess since I graduated from
Beauregard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now where is Beauregard Junior High School located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. On Canal Street, but I don't know the address. It is near the
end of the streetcar line, near the cemeteries, across the street from St.
Anthony's Church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is it near the downtown section of Canal Street, or is it out
farther?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No; well, it is further down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Approximately how far would it be from where we are now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Oh, it is all the way down at the other end of Canal Street. I
mean, you know how it is? The river is down here [indicating]. Well, it is
on the other side of town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Quite a way from here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Oh, yes, sir. I mean, you take the streetcar and you ride
practically to the end of the line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Before you got to Beauregard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. It is about three blocks from the end of the line, the end of the
streetcar line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So it would be several miles from here, would it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir; I guess&mdash;let's see&mdash;it must be about the 4000 or 6000
block, something like that, of Canal Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In the 6000 block?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I think so. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is Beauregard we are talking about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Beauregard; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell me the area the people that went to Beauregard
Junior High School came from? Was it just the area surrounding the school,
or did they come from all parts of New Orleans, or just how did they decide
who was to go to that high school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Each high school has its own district, so that the people that
lived in Lakeview went to Beauregard. If you lived in Gentilly, you couldn't
go to Beauregard unless you got a permit from the school board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What kind of neighborhood was it? What kind of a district
was it that Beauregard drew its students from back in 1954, and 1955?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, it's a nice neighborhood, it still is today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Has it changed much since then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you say that it draws from an upper-middle class
or middle-class neighborhood?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Middle-class neighborhood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't have any idea where Lee Oswald lived during the
time that he went to Beauregard, do you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No; sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever know that he lived in Exchange Alley?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; not until I seen it in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Off the record a minute.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You said that after you graduated from Beauregard Junior
High School you went to Warren Easton High School? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now does Warren Easton High School also draw from a
particular district, or is that operated on a different principle than Beauregard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That draws from a district too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that district included the district encompassed by Beauregard
Junior High School?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; and also, well, around Easton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It includes other districts aside from the Beauregard Junior
High School District, does it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, all the kids that went to Beauregard automatically went
to Easton, of course, unless they moved out of the district, but it drew kids
that lived around Easton too. I mean the district widened, it got larger like
from Beauregard to Easton, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know that Lee Oswald attended Warren Easton High
School?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I can remember seeing him there. My girl friends didn't, but
I remembered seeing him, you know, walking down the hall or walking outside
of school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But nothing else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. But as far as recalling anything about him at Warren Easton
other than that, I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There wasn't any event that he was involved in that stands
out in your mind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember when you saw Lee Oswald at Warren Easton?
Was it immediately after you started Warren Easton after graduating from
Beauregard Junior High School?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; it was right after we had started at Warren Easton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You yourself did graduate from Warren Easton, did you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You actually attended Warren Easton for three years? Is
that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember seeing Lee Oswald over a long period of
time at Warren Easton, or was it just for a part?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No; just&mdash;I may have just seen him once or twice at the beginning
of the school year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Warren Easton students come from pretty much the same
kind of family background or the same kind of economic and social background
as the people who went to Beauregard Junior High School?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I think so, but there were a few kids&mdash;well, boys&mdash;that <span class="locked">were&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Of a somewhat rougher nature, shall we say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; I wouldn't want to say hoodlums, but they were, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There were people from a different class or different group of
society?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. There were rumors that some of them took dope. Of course, I
don't know how true it is, but that is what they say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never had any knowledge of anything like that or heard
any rumors about that at Beauregard, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No; I never have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If you can think of anything else about Lee Oswald that I
haven't asked you about, we would appreciate it very much if you would set
it forth on the record now. Can you think of anything else that we haven't
covered?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. There isn't anything else I can think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have no other questions at this point. I do want to thank
you for coming down and cooperating with us to the extent that you have, and,
on behalf of the Commission I want to thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="t27"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_FREDERICK_S_OSULLIVAN" id="TESTIMONY_OF_FREDERICK_S_OSULLIVAN">TESTIMONY OF FREDERICK S. O'SULLIVAN</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Frederick S. O'Sullivan was taken on April 7&ndash;8, 1964, at
the Old Civil Courts Building, Royal and Conti Streets, New Orleans, La., by
Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Frederick S. O'Sullivan, having been first duly sworn, was examined and
testified as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am a member of the legal
staff of the President's Commission investigating the assassination of President
Kennedy. Staff members have been authorized to take the testimony of witnesses
by the Commission pursuant to authority granted to the Commission by
Executive Order No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution of
Congress No. 137.</p>

<p>I understand that Mr. Rankin wrote to you last week telling you that I would
be in touch with you concerning the taking of your testimony, and that he enclosed
with his letter a copy of the Executive order and the joint resolution
just referred to, as well as a copy of the rules of procedure of the Commission
relating to the taking of testimony of witnesses. Did you receive the letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The documents I referred to were enclosed with it; were they
not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. One of the things the Commission is interested in is the background
of Lee Harvey Oswald, the alleged assassin, to the extent that knowledge
of his background can assist the Commission in evaluating Mr. Oswald's
possible motive, if it is true, as it was alleged, that he was the assassin. Before
we get into the knowledge that you may have of Oswald, would you state your
full name for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Frederick Stephen Patrick O'Sullivan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your address, Mr. O'Sullivan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. 413 Heritage Avenue, Gretna, La.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are a member of the New Orleans Police Department, as I
understand. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are a detective on the vice squad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long have you been with the New Orleans Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Six years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were born here in New Orleans? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And how old are you now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Twenty-six.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I understand that you knew Lee Oswald when he attended a
junior high school here in New Orleans. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Yes; Beauregard Junior High.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Beauregard Junior High?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. On Canal Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your own education included attendance at Beauregard Junior
High School?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. It did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long did you go to Beauregard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. One year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And where did you go prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. St. Dominic's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. St. Dominic's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Elementary school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Here in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. In Lakeview in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After you left Beauregard, where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. I went to Warren Easton Senior High School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that here in New Orleans also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And did you graduate from Warren Easton High School?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you attend college at any place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Yes; I am in college in Loyola right now through a police
department scholarship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us everything that you can remember about Oswald
when you knew him at Beauregard Junior High School, how you met him,
what contacts you had with him, just the whole story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. All right. I was a cadet in Civil Air Patrol, and while
I was in Beauregard we were having a recruiting drive to get more cadet
members in the New Orleans squadron, and there were three fellows at the
school that I talked to in particular about joining that. One was Joseph
Thompson, one was Edward Voebel&mdash;I am not sure how that name is spelled&mdash;and
Lee Harvey Oswald. My reason for asking Oswald to join was I noticed&mdash;we
had a drill team, we were real proud of our drill team.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was a marching team?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. A marching unit; yes, sir, and Oswald carried himself
always erect, always gave the impression that he could be marching, that he
may be marching, eyes straight ahead, head straight, shoulders back, so he
impressed me as the sort of a fellow that would really fit well on the drill
team. He seemed like he could&mdash;well, he even gave the impression that he would
make a pretty good leader if he ever got into the squadron, so with this recruiting
drive I asked the three of them to come out to the airport. I explained
what we did out there, marching and flying on the weekends and so forth to
them at school. Joseph Thompson and Oswald and Voebel all three came
out to the airport. Joe Thompson stayed in the squadron, and Oswald came
to one or two meetings, possibly three, along with Voebel. However, Voebel
then joined the Civil Air Patrol at Moisant Airport, and because he was a
closer friend of Oswald, he evidently talked Oswald into coming out to the
squadron he had joined.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At Moisant Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. At Moisant Airport.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Yes. Incidentally, Oswald&mdash;I didn't know this until I
read it in the paper&mdash;lived only a half a block from me for a short time. I
lived in Lakeview at 800 French Street, I believe, and he lived either in the
800 or the 700 block of French Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That would have been in 1963 when he came here to New
Orleans? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Oh, I didn't live there at that time. No, I moved from
French Street around 1957.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember anything else about Oswald at the time
he was in Beauregard Junior High School with you, about his friendships?
Did he have many friends at that time, or do you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. No; I believe he and I, because of the spelling of our last
names, were possibly in the same homeroom in the morning, but I really
don't recall anything. I don't recall much about any of the students at Beauregard
or at Warren Easton. I sort of&mdash;I was an athlete, and we stayed
away from the rest of the students. They had a thing that they kept us
away from the rest of the students pretty much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say you were an athlete at Beauregard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What particular sport were you involved in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Football and track, and the same at Warren Easton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald, as far as you know, ever have anything to do
with sports activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember whether Oswald and Voebel were close
acquaintances at that time, or do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Only in that Voebel left the New Orleans squadron and went
out to Moisant and evidently&mdash;or I believe he talked Oswald into coming out
there with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now you don't know of your own knowledge whether or not
Oswald ever did join the Civil Air Patrol, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. No; I don't know that he signed any papers or had uniforms
or anything. I know that he came out to New Orleans Airport and
attended some of the meetings, but whether he just&mdash;you see, a lot of time
people would come out and sit in the classes to decide whether they wanted
to join or not. We will allow this, hoping to get more cadets. I don't know
that he ever signed any papers or joined. You can check with the Louisiana
Wing Headquarters and they can give it to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know whether Oswald ever did actually go out to
Moisant Field to Civil Air Patrol meetings at that place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have rifles as a part of your Civil Air Patrol program?
Did you have rifle practice and drill with rifles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. We didn't drill with rifles, but we did belong to the NRA
and we did fire rifles on the range, and also when we went to summer camp
we would fire on the range.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. NRA is the National Rifle Association? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What kind of rifles did you fire when you went to summer
camp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Now I am getting summer camp mixed up with the National
Guard. I believe we fired .22's in the CAP.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever observe Oswald engage in rifle practice of any
kind in connection with CAP activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether or not Oswald ever did engage in any
rifle practice in connection with the CAP?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know David Ferrie, F-e-r-r-i-e?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Yes, sir; I know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know of any connection between Oswald and David
Ferrie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. No; I have no personal knowledge of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Ferrie was involved with the CAP squadron at New Orleans
Airport at the time Voebel and Oswald came out to join it? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Ferrie was in charge of the squadron, and then there was
a Captain Hinton. Now I was in the squadron for 6 years, so I am not sure
who was in charge at what particular time. I am not sure. He could have
been. He may have been, but I am not sure. I know that when he left the
New Orleans squadron, Ferrie did have something to do with the Moisant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
squadron, so he may have. If he wasn't in charge when Oswald was out at
New Orleans Airport, he may have been in charge when he went to Moisant
Airport.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you don't know of any time that Oswald associated with
or knew Ferrie through the Civil Air Patrol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. No; I am not sure of any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now you said that you had no personal knowledge or no direct
knowledge of any relationship between Oswald and Ferrie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any information that would lead you to believe
that there was a relationship between these two men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Only that when all of this broke with Oswald, I went
through all of the old CAP files that were available, trying to get some information
for the Secret Service, the people who had called me up at home, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where were these files located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. These files are in the possession of one Robert Boylston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. He was also a member of the CAP at the time we all were,
at New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did the records come to be in his possession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. He is a senior member now. He has maybe recently dropped
out, but he was a senior member and these records were just turned over to
him in the whole filing cabinet. They are all old records. I am trying to get
the thing straight in my mind. Of course, I have been trying to get it straight
in my mind, just what I know and what I have heard. It gets kind of confusing
when you read so much. Sometimes you remember things that you
don't really remember, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you find anything in these files that related to Ferrie or
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Well, we found papers signed by Ferrie but nothing in relation
to Oswald. His name wasn't mentioned in anything at all that we could
find, so we assumed at that time that Oswald was in the Moisant squadron.
I believe they even had in the paper the dates, and we checked those particular
dates and it turned out that Ferrie was in a transition between the New Orleans
squadron and the Moisant squadron in these dates, so he could have been involved
either way with Oswald. I don't know if he was involved, he could have
been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you found nothing in the files?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Nothing concrete.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That you investigated as to the relation between Oswald and
Ferrie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Am I correct in understanding that there has been publicity
here in the New Orleans area concerning a possible relationship between Oswald
and Ferrie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Yes, sir; I believe Captain Ferrie was arrested. I am sure
he was arrested, and I believe it was in connection with this Oswald situation.
He was booked at the first district station. I don't know just what he was
charged with, I believe just 107, under investigation of whatever it was, I don't
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now you go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Lieutenant Dwyer, Paul Dwyer, from the New Orleans Police
Department, intelligence division, I accompanied him out to New Orleans Airport
where we found Dave Ferrie's airplane. We wanted to check it to see if it
was flyable, to see possibly whether he had been flying it lately, with the thought
that he may have transported Oswald to Dallas. This isn't my thought, this was
brought up to me, and we found his plane, but his plane was not in flyable condition.
It had flat tires, instruments missing, needed a paint job. We also
checked to see if he had rented an aircraft from any of the companies out there,
and one company in particular said that they wouldn't rent him an airplane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did they tell you why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are a detective on the vice squad? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you assigned to a particular aspect of vice activities here
in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. No, sir; there are only nine of us to cover the whole city.
Therefore, we handle any vice, gambling, prostitution, homosexuals, handbooks.
Anything that comes under the vice laws, we handle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have never had any contact with Ferrie in connection
with your activities on the vice squad? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. No; Ferrie lives or he did live in Jefferson Parish. We have
no authority in Jefferson Parish. [Deletion.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now see if you can recall or think back to your experiences in
the Beauregard Junior High School, and tell us if you can remember anything
else or if there is anything else that you want to add what you have already said
about your knowledge of Oswald and his activities at the time he was at Beauregard
Junior High School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Well, I have put quite a bit of thought on this ever since it
all happened, especially since I have gotten this correspondence relative to what
I know about it, and as much as I would like to help you as much as I can, I
just can't think of anything else. I don't want to say something I am not sure
of. Well, actually, even if I thought of something, I would tell you and tell you
I am not sure, but there is nothing else I can think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. All right. I have no other questions at this time, and if there
is nothing else that you want to add to the record, on behalf of the Commission,
I want to thank you very much for your cooperation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Sullivan</span>. Yes, sir; thank you.</p>

<h2 id="t31"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_MRS_MILDRED_SAWYER" id="TESTIMONY_OF_MRS_MILDRED_SAWYER">TESTIMONY OF MRS. MILDRED SAWYER</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Mrs. Mildred Sawyer was taken on April 7&ndash;8, 1964, at the Old
Civil Courts Building, Royal and Conti Streets, New Orleans, La., by Mr.
Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mrs. Mildred Sawyer, having been first duly sworn, was examined and testified
as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am a member of the legal
staff of the President's Commission investigating the assassination of President
Kennedy. The Commission staff members have been authorized to take the
testimony of witnesses by the Commission pursuant to authority to the Commission
by Executive Order No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution
of Congress No. 137.</p>

<p>I understand that Mr. Rankin wrote to you last week and told you that we
would be in touch with you about the taking of your testimony.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that he enclosed with that letter a copy of the Executive
order and the congressional resolution to which I have just referred, and also
a copy of the Commission's rules governing the taking of testimony of witnesses.
Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That is correct. At the time that I spoke to your Mr. Gerrets
last night, I hadn't gone through some mail that was in my place and had been
picked up by my aunt when she came by and picked up the mail on that Saturday
morning, and I hadn't even bothered going through it, because most of the
time the mail I have is just bills or some advertisements, and it is very inconsequential,
so, as a result, after hearing that I was supposed to have a letter, I
became a little curious and looked, and I found that there was one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Good. Technically, witnesses are entitled to 3 days' notice
before being required to appear. I don't think you had quite 3 days' notice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
but you can waive that if you want to. As long as you are here, I assume you
will want to go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Certainly. I will be very glad to, because I am afraid there
is very little I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't think we will take very long, actually, but one of the
things the Commission is trying to do is develop as much background knowledge
about Lee Harvey Oswald as it possibly can, in the hope that it might give some
insight into his possible motive, if in fact he did assassinate the President.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you state your full name for the record?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Mildred Sawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I live in Lakeview; 6306 Louisville Street; part of the time
with my father, and then I have a little place on Exchange Place where I
kept my husband's books and things, where we always worked, more or less
a little office, and when the weather was bad or when I felt too pressed with
work, or if I am tired and don't feel like going to dad's, I stay there. My husband
and I had the place arranged so, whenever we wanted to, we could stay there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your husband is deceased? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long have you lived at the Exchange Place apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Oh, whenever the Monteleone Hotel took over the place where
we were living, which belonged to Mr. Saussaye, on Royal Street, and he owned
that building there, and the Monteleone Hotel&mdash;you remember when they tore
it down and remodeled to make a parking garage there? We had to leave at
that time, and then we were looking for some little place to store all our books
and everything&mdash;my husband was an engineer and we had a lot of things that
we worked on, and he was in and out of the city, so when he came in it was very
convenient to have someplace like that where we could work sometimes, if we
felt like it, way past midnight, and that would have disturbed my father, who
was quite old&mdash;he is 91, in fact&mdash;so that is how we started looking around, and
we found this little place and took it, and I have been going back and forth ever
since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That would have been in the 1950's sometime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I am trying to recall the year, but really I can't without looking
at my receipts. It would be hard for me to remember that. My husband died
2 years ago in November, and we were there at least 3 years or 4 years, I think.
I am not certain of the time. I mean it is kind of hard for me to reconstruct,
to go back. Anyway, whatever it was, when we moved there these people, this
Mrs. Oswald and her son, were living there in the apartment below the one that
we took, and they remained there a short while, and they moved away after
that and I never heard any more or anything until then, and I had forgotten all
about the name of the people or anything until finally your men called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mean you were interviewed by someone from the FBI
sometime back in November?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes. There was an FBI man who called me sometime back,
and that is when I realized that they were the same people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you become acquainted with Mrs. Oswald to any extent
during the time that you lived at this Exchange Place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Not really, because&mdash;well, she was old enough to be my mother,
I might say, and our working all the time&mdash;and so was my husband&mdash;and then
I was connected with the opera group here and I was out most of the time, and
when we met it was usually on the stairway or in and out the door, once in
awhile talking on the steps, perhaps. About the most we did was bid each
other the time of day, and that is about all, and, of course, the little boy the
same thing. And I say "little boy" because to me he was a child when I saw
him. I can vaguely remember, or I have a mental picture of, a little boy with
blond, curly hair and rather nice looking, and that is about all I can say, and
once in a while if he happened to be going out or coming in at the time I was
going, he would always open the door and hold the door for me, and he seemed
quite polite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He was about 14 years old?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I would say he must have been about 14. I say he was a little
boy because I am sure he was an early teenager. Of course, as I say, I have
lost track of time then. I was wondering how old he actually is or was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is the address of this place 126 Exchange Place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It is not in Exchange Alley?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. It is Exchange Place, and Exchange Place and Exchange Alley
are one and the same thing. Years ago they used to be called Exchange Alley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know what Mrs. Oswald did for a living?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes. That much I do know, because I believe she was working
as a clerk in Kreeger's, but I am not positive. I have been trying to think since
I had to come here, and she left there, and I believe she either went to Goldring's
or Godchaux's&mdash;I don't remember which&mdash;because she met me on the
street one day and asked if I was buying any clothes and would I not come by
and buy from her so that she might get the commission or show me something
I might be interested in. In fact, I never did go; I never did buy, though. I
never did go to her for anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The only two people that lived in the apartment were Mrs.
Oswald and this boy? Is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know how big an apartment it was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Well, I imagine it consisted of about the same size or same
things as the one that we have; that is, a large living room, combination dining
room or a little dining alcove, and a small bath, a small kitchen, and a rather
large bedroom with large closet space, and I am sure&mdash;seeing it, well, I would
say the stretch of the building going up the stairway, I would say that it was
the same thing, or close to it anyway. I am sure it had the same dimensions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember anything about Lee Oswald, the boy that
lived there? I think you told the FBI that he would always get home before
his mother and he was very quiet.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Well, I say I am not certain that he always got home before
his mother. I imagine he came home from school, because, as I say, occasionally
I met him going up and down the stairway or at the door or something like
that, but he was not a boisterous child and undoubtedly he was not an unruly
child, because I am sure if he had been and she had scolded him we would have
heard it unless it was very low voiced <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you never did hear any arguments between them or any
scolding?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he seem to be polite?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes; quite polite. I mean, in fact, that was one of the things
that impressed me about him, because most kids these days, especially the
teenagers, are usually so abrupt. They don't think very much of manners, but,
in fact, if I happened to come in and he was out at the doorway, he held the
door and closed it after me, or something like that, and I thought it was rather
nice, but I never got into any conversations with him, because I make it a point
that, outside of my own circle of friends, I don't really care to become friendly
with other people, and I think neighbors especially.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know whether he had any friends from school or anyplace
come to visit him, people his own age? Did you see anyone come and go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I never did, but then, like I say, I am out from 8 o'clock in the
morning until maybe 5:30, 6, or 7 in the evening, and sometimes I get a snack and
go back to work again and work until maybe 9 o'clock or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What were you doing at that time? Were you working?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Secretary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Secretarial work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you employed as a secretary now, too?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I do secretarial work or general or anything like that that I am
qualified to do. Well, anything along those lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you employed at the present time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember the circumstances under which the Oswalds
left the Exchange Place apartment? Did they tell you where they were going or
anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No; I didn't&mdash;I don't recall her saying anything about where
she was going particularly. I know one day my husband told me that she was
packing furniture or something and preparing to leave, and shortly after that
evidently her things were picked up, because when I came back, well, they were
gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As far as you can recall, there was nothing peculiar or particularly
outstanding about this boy that would call notice to him to distinguish him
from other boys his age?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Really, no; I wouldn't say anything that I can think of, and, as
I say, I never came in contact with him long enough or spoke to him, and they
were just average people. She just seemed like a very average mother, and I
rather imagined in my own mind that she worked and probably did all she could
to take care of him as any mother would. About the only thing I remembered
about him was the fact that he was rather a nice-looking little boy, and his blond,
curly hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know of any friends that Mrs. Oswald had during that
time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No; I don't, and, of course, I could venture to say that she
probably had friends at the stores where she worked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you didn't know any of them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I didn't know any of them, because I made no contacts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't think I have any more questions, Mrs. Sawyer. If you
can think of anything else that you want to add or anything that you think we
ought to know, that we haven't asked you about, or if you can remember anything
else about the Oswalds that we haven't <span class="locked">covered&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No; well, about the only thing I can tell you is that apparently
she was a very kindly person, because the day that we moved into the place, when
we had so many books and things to take up, and it was rather a struggle and
stairs to climb, and I guess we might have been pretty tired&mdash;well, she came out
of her doorway and brought coffee to both of us right there on the stairway, and
that was the first contact we had with her that we had ever seen her, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She seemed to be friendly?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. She seemed to be a pleasant person, a friendly person, but I
would say very average, I would think. She seemed to be well spoken, I would
say average education, possibly not college or anything like that. I was really
quite amazed at such a thing happening to this little boy, because, as I said, my
picture of him, my mental picture I did remember seemed to be such a pleasant
one that something like that came as pretty much of a shock that a child who
seemed to be so nice would be involved in anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever talk about politics with you, or did you ever hear
him talking about politics to anybody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No, no; because, as I said, I never met him any more than just
saying good morning&mdash;and he did say that&mdash;or good evening or something like
that, but I never engaged in any conversations with him at all. I considered him
just a child, and I would hardly think at 14 years old he would have engaged in
political talk, or else he would have been <span class="locked">quite&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Precocious?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. True.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, if you don't have anything else that you can think of, I
have no more questions. We want to thank you very much for coming over.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Well, you are quite welcome.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And for waiting until we got to you, both for myself personally,
and the Commission through me expresses its thanks for the cooperation that
you have given us.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Well, you are quite welcome. I am sorry that all I know is so
vague and such a little bit.</p>

<h2 id="t35"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_MRS_ANNE_BOUDREAUX" id="TESTIMONY_OF_MRS_ANNE_BOUDREAUX">TESTIMONY OF MRS. ANNE BOUDREAUX</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Mrs. Anne Boudreaux was taken on April 7, 1964, at the
Old Civil Courts Building, Royal and Conti Streets, New Orleans, La., by Mr.
Albert E. Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mrs. Anne Boudreaux, 831 Pauline Street, New Orleans, La., after first being
duly sworn, testified as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are Mrs. Anne Boudreaux, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your husband's name is Edward?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Boudreaux, you received a letter from the general counsel
of the Commission, did you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In which was enclosed a copy of Senate Joint Resolution 137,
which authorized the creation of the Commission to investigate the assassination
of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes; I have the letter with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the order of Lyndon B. Johnson, the President of the United
States, bringing the Commission into existence and fixing its powers and
duties?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And a copy of our rules and regulations under which we take
testimony before the Commission and also by way of deposition, such as this
one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. I therefore take it you understand from those documents
that the Commission was authorized and appointed to investigate all
the facts and circumstances surrounding the assassination of President John
Fitzgerald Kennedy on the 22d of November 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am Albert E. Jenner, Jr., member of the legal staff, of the
Commission, and I would like to inquire of you a little bit to see if you can't
give us some information that will help the Commission in its investigation.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We are seeking to elicit from those who came into contact with
Lee Harvey Oswald and his brothers and his mother and others, information
that may be helpful to the Commission in its work, and the Commission very
much appreciates your coming down here today, because these are always
a little inconvenient, of course.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, Mrs. Boudreaux, you live at 831 Pauline Street,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long have you lived at 831 Pauline?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Since 1932&mdash;no, I beg your pardon, 1942; since June 15, 1942.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1942, rather than 1932?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, that's right. I wasn't thinking right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, are you a native of this part of the country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were born here and reared here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. I was born in Louisiana, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. My husband too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have a family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How many children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. I have five children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What are their ages, Mrs. Boudreaux?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. 22, 17, two 16's, and one 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Two 16's?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, who was the previous occupant of your home, if you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's Mrs. Marguerite Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, Marguerite Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you become acquainted with her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. No, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know to where she moved when you took over that
house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. No, I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That home is a single family dwelling, is it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. It's a double house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A double house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that up and down, or side by side?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Two sides.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Side by side with a common party wall, I suppose?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who occupies the other house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. On the other side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. It's a Mr. Russo.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Russo?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Him and his wife, but they were living there when I moved
in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you moved in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, sir; they were there already.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you learn of any particular circumstances which brought
about or played a part in Mrs. Oswald's leaving those premises?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. No; I didn't. I didn't hear anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you become acquainted with someone who in turn had some
experiences with Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, sir; like I told the detective that came to see me,
that was Mrs. Roach; she's dead now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Roach?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did she live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. She lived with them for about 2 weeks. She was their
babysitter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, babysitter for Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, sir; for the baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She baby-sat for Lee Oswald then, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she live in that neighborhood?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes. She used to live on Lesseps Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is where with respect to your home; about how far away?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Well, about 6 blocks, I guess. It's right about a block
from the Port of Embarkation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she would come over and babysit for Lee, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Well, she stayed with Mrs. Oswald for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She actually moved into the home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, for 2 weeks she moved in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Well, that was right before Mrs. Oswald moved out, and I
moved in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Shortly before that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, it wasn't long before that. In fact, it was through her
that I knew the house was going to be empty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Through Mrs. Roach?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had been acquainted with her for some time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Mrs. Roach?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Oh, yes. I had known Mrs. Roach since I was a little bitty
girl. She was in the Oswald home either in the early part of June or the latter
part of May 1942.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have some conversations with her at the time with
respect to Lee's conduct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Who, Mrs. Roach?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; with respect to Lee's conduct while she was babysitting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes; she usually talked about things like that, you know,
and she said the reason why she had to leave was because he was bad, and he
wouldn't listen, and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The reason why Mrs. Roach had to leave?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, sir; she said she just couldn't take it any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lee then would have been about 2½ years old, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A little more than that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes. She said she just couldn't take it any longer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me as best you can what Mrs. Roach recalled in that conversation
with you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Well, she said he wouldn't listen, and he was bad. She
said he had a little toy gun, and he threw it at her and broke the chandelier
in the bedroom, and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of course, at that age he wouldn't know whether it was a gun
or not, or what a gun was, would he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. No, but you know, she said it was just a little toy gun, but
he threw it at her when he got mad, and she had an awful time with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She thought he exhibited fits of temper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes. She said he was a, I mean, a bad child; that's what
she said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say anything about the other two boys.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. No, she didn't. In fact, I didn't even know about the other
boys until the man told me who he was. I didn't know she had other boys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That man who told you that, was he from the FBI or the Secret
Service?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes; he came out three times to see me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you moved into that home, what was the reputation in
the neighborhood or community with respect to Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Well, nobody ever talked about her. You know, neighbors
sort of keep to themselves. I mean, that's a neighborhood that whoever moves
in they keep to themselves. They don't make up to you too quickly, I mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But as far as the general reputation is concerned, what was
her reputation for truth and veracity, for example?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Well, they have never spoken about that, at least to me, I
mean, the neighbors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You never heard anything bad about her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. No, I never did, and as far as her being a good mother to
her children, well, I have never heard anything other than good. I have
never heard anything spoken about her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When her son Lee was 2½ years old, was she working at that
time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. I think she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that why she had to have a babysitter.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes; that's why she had had the babysitter. I mean, the lady
that could tell you all about that, she's dead&mdash;Mrs. Roach. She's deceased.
She could have told you a lot more about all that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you learn as to how long she had been living there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Well, I don't know how long she had been living there when
I moved in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where is 831 Pauline Street with respect to 1012 Bartholomew?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. That would be about 4 blocks, I would say, from where I
live.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From 1012 Bartholomew to where you live would be about 4
blocks?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you learn that she lived at one time at 1010 Bartholomew?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. No; I didn't. I don't know where she lived after she left
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were these rented homes, or could you purchase them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. The one where I was living?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. They were rented, but now I own my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But they were being rented at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The former landlady, is she alive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. No; she's not.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She's dead?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes; she's dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Until this tragic event occurred last fall, had you heard of any
of the Oswalds from the time they moved away?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. No; I didn't know until the FBI man told me&mdash;until he
got to questioning me, that it was the boy who lived in that house. I didn't
realize that until he told me. The only other contact I had&mdash;I don't know if
it's important or <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you let us decide what is important and what isn't. We
want to get all the information we can possibly get as to the facts and circumstances
surrounding this matter; so you go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Well, I bought the boy's baby bed, and I gave Mrs. Roach
the money to pay for it, and she left the bed in the house, and then they never
came back for the money, I don't think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In advance of moving in, you purchased their baby bed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes; I bought the bed, which I still have, and I raised all
my children with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes; I raised my five children with it, and I intend to
give it to them even though this happened. Like I say, it wasn't concerning
them at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, these depositions will be written up by the court reporter,
and you have the privilege, if you wish, of reading your deposition and signing
it, but you can waive that if you want so as to avoid the inconvenience of
coming down here again, but if you wish to read it and sign it, that's your
privilege. If you decide to waive the reading and signing of the deposition,
the court reporter will transcribe it, and it will be sent by the U.S. attorney to
Washington to be read by the members of the Commission conducting this
investigation.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. I don't need to sign it. All I was saying was the truth, and
that's all I can do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then I take it you would just as soon waive the necessity of
reading and signing the deposition?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Boudreaux</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Very well; thank you very much for appearing here voluntarily
and giving us your statement.</p>

<h2 id="t38"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_MRS_VIOLA_PETERMAN" id="TESTIMONY_OF_MRS_VIOLA_PETERMAN">TESTIMONY OF MRS. VIOLA PETERMAN</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Mrs. Viola Peterman was taken on April 7, 1964, at the
Old Civil Courts Building, Royal and Conti Streets, New Orleans, La., by Mr.
Albert E. Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Viola Peterman, 1012 Bartholomew Street, New Orleans, La., after
first being duly sworn, testified as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is Mrs. Mildred Peterman, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. No; that's Milfred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Milfred?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes; that's M-i-l-f-r-e-d. That's my husband's name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It's Mrs. Milfred Peterman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your given name, Mrs. Peterman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Viola.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that V-i-o-l-a?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You received a letter recently from Mr. Rankin; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The general counsel of the Warren Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was enclosed with the letter three documents, weren't
there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. One was the Senate joint resolution authorizing the creation
of the Presidential Commission to investigate the assassination of President
John Fitzgerald Kennedy; another was the Executive order of President Johnson
appointing that Commission and fixing its powers and its duties, and the
other was a copy of the rules and regulations under which we take depositions,
such as this one, and have testimony before the Commission; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you understand from those documents, Mrs. Peterman, that
the Commission is directed by the President to investigate the facts and circumstances
surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In that connection, we of the Commission's legal staff, in addition
to presenting evidence before the Commission itself, are deposing various
people around the country whose lives came into contact with Lee Harvey
Oswald and with other individuals involved, or possibly involved, in the
assassination, and we understand that you have some information that might
be helpful to us; is that right, Mrs. Peterman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Well, I can only tell you what I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's all we ask, Mrs. Peterman. First, let me ask, are you a
native of this part of the country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes; New Orleans, La.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were born here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was your husband likewise born here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what is his business or occupation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Well, he's retired now. He was taking care of the building
and things over at LSU, but he retired last year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He retired last year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes; since March last year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I understand you were acquainted with Marguerite Oswald,
mother of Lee Oswald; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes; she lived right next door to me, at 1010 Bartholomew.
I live at 1012 Bartholomew, but, gee, that was 23 years ago that they lived
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She lived at 1010 Bartholomew, right next door to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long have you lived at 1012 Bartholomew, Mrs. Peterman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Well, let's see&mdash;I moved there in 1941; that's been 23 years
ago that I moved there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she already living there when you moved there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes; she was there, I would say, well, it couldn't have been
more than a month before we moved there, because both of the houses was sold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
at the same time, but we bought ours after she did, because she was in there
first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were these relatively new houses?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. No; they were old places.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They had been lived in before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say you lived next door to each other, was that across
the street from each other, or right next door, on the same side of the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Right next door. There were three single homes on two
lots, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Three single-family dwellings on two lots?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes; on two city lots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are they identical houses?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Well, they were when we bought them, but everybody fixed
theirs up different, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Describe those houses for me.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were they four-room, five-room, or six-room dwellings, and so
forth&mdash;give me just a general idea of how they were composed, and how large.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Well, they had four rooms and a bath is all; just straight
houses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Four rooms and a bath?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of what construction; wood?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Wood; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any children, Mrs. Peterman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. I had four children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What were their ages around that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. When she moved there and we moved there; right around
that time, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Well, let's see; my oldest girl was 21; my boy was 12; my
next girl was 10; and the other one was 8.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your eldest child was a boy or girl?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. A girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And her present name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. She's a Herrmann now. She married Felix Herrmann.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How do you spell that&mdash;Herrmann?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. I think it's H-e-r-r-m-a-n-n.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What's her first name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Marian is her first name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does she still live in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Well, she lives down in Chalmette.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that near here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. That's down in St. Bernard; below, in St. Bernard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that a city?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. What, Chalmette?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. I wouldn't call it a city; it's a different part of St. Bernard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But it's in the vicinity of New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She's now what; 45?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. No; she's going to be 46, I think; I am pretty sure she will
be 46.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she living at home at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. You mean when Marguerite was living next door to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes; she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your next was then 12 years old; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that a boy or girl?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Emile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where does he live now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. He lives, I think it's 13 St. Claude Court.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. St. Claude Court?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then your next was a 10-year-old; right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was her name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Myra; another girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Myra?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Myra is now married; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What's her married name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Davis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What's the name of her husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Eddie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Edward?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. No, Eddie; E-d-d-i-e is how they spell it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does he work here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes; at Public Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where do they live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. They live on Cedar Avenue&mdash;713 Cedar Avenue, in Metairie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Metairie?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that part of New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes; that's in Jeff Parish, but it's part of New Orleans. It
runs into it, I mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right; and then your youngest?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Let me explain about her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. She wasn't really my own. She was my husband's sister's
child. I didn't adopt her, but I raised her. The father and mother both died,
and I raised her from 5 years old. She went by her own name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Her name was&mdash;when she was single, Welbrock, but she
married, and now it's Kushler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that's the one that you said was 8 years old at the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes; at that time, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was her first name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Cecelia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she's married, and her name is now Kushler?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they reside where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. 3207 Rabbit Street, Gentilly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Rabbit Street in Gentilly?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that a part of New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes; it's the part out by the lake.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which lake?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Lake Pontchartrain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right; now, Emile; how old is he now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Emile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. He will be 34; no, 35. He will be 35 in September. He's 34
right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He's 34 now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Myra will be how old?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. She made 32 in February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Cecelia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. She will be 30 this month&mdash;I mean, in May&mdash;May 15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So at that time, Emile, Myra and Cecelia were attending elementary
school, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they all attend the same school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. They went to Washington, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Washington Elementary School?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where is that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. St. Claude and Alvar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your son Felix; had he graduated from both elementary
school and high school at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Who is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, I'm sorry; your daughter Marian. Did she graduate from
high school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. No; she went through Washington, and then she went to
high school 3 weeks or thereabouts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You became acquainted with Marguerite Oswald immediately
when you moved into those houses, I assume; did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. No, I wouldn't say that. She was a person that kept to herself,
and I did the same. She must have lived there about 3 years, maybe a
little less, but I didn't bother her and she didn't bother me. I had my hands
full with my children, and she had three little ones herself, so she had her hands
full. We would speak, but that was about all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you did become acquainted with her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Oh, yes; I would say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were aware that she had three children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Three boys, yes. The oldest one was John Pic, because she
married his father before she married Oswald. She told me that herself, but
now whether she was divorced from him or whether he was dead, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, one of her boys was John Pic, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes, P-I-C-K.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I think it's P-I-C, and her second boy <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Robert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the third?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lee was the third one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, at this particular time John and Robert were about within
the age range of your three younger children; that's Emile, Myra and Cecelia;
is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Well, they were more around Cecelia's age.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Around Cecelia's age?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lee, however, was considerably younger, was he not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes. He must have been not quite 18 months when she moved
there, maybe less; that's 23 years ago, you know, and it's hard to recall all of
that, to be exact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's all right. We want you to just give us the information as
you recall it. Now, Robert was about what age at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. I really couldn't say, but I imagine about 4 or 5. I really
don't know to be exact on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And John?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. He must have been at least 7 or 8, because he was going to
school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So she had Lee, who was a baby infant, you might say, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And another child who was not yet of school age, and that would
be Robert?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And John, her eldest. Was John attending Washington Elementary
at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. I am almost sure he did, but I wouldn't swear to that; I am
not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So as I get it, during the 3 years that they lived there, Robert
eventually entered Washington Elementary School, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Well, I couldn't say that. In fact, I think she moved before
that, because she didn't stay there long. I don't think it was 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About 2 years maybe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Maybe along in there; she moved before 3 years, I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say she was inclined to keep to herself most of the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes, she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't regard that as strange, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. No; I am a person like that myself. I don't bother much with
the neighbors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it from what you have told me, Mrs. Peterman, that
Marguerite Oswald was unmarried at the time, that she had just divorced her
husband, or been divorced by him, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Well, the first one I don't know, but the second one was dead.
He died and left her a widow. She told me that herself when she moved there.
Now, her first husband, I didn't know whether he was dead, living, or what.
She never mentioned him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you say you moved into that house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. In 1941.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You moved there in 1941?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Well, in any event she was unmarried at that time,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know how she supported herself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Well, at first I don't. I know she told me that she sold
her house, where they came from, but how much that was or anything I don't
know. She might have had insurance from him; I don't know. Then later
she opened a little dry goods store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A dry goods store?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. I won't say a dry goods store&mdash;more like a grocery store, I
guess you would say&mdash;just a small place there in the front room. She sold
bread, milk, candy, and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. In her front room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The front room of her house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes; it was a little grocery store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would the local city ordinances permit that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. I don't know about that, but she did operate it for a short
time&mdash;not too long. Finally she gave that up, but as far as I know that was
the only money she had coming in at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give me your impression of Mrs. Oswald, would you please;
what kind of person she was.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Well, like I said&mdash;I don't know how to explain it, but she
was a person who was not overfriendly, and she wasn't no snob either. I can't
say that, but I don't know. She was the kind of a person that&mdash;I don't know
how to say it. I mean, I had no trouble with her, and she was a good mother
to her children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. That she was, and she would always keep, like I say, to
herself. She didn't do much talking, that is, to me; but now whether she did
to the other neighbors, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't regard her conduct as strange?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. No; nothing like that. Like I told you, I am the kind of
person who keeps to myself too. I have been right now 23 years in that neighborhood,
I&mdash;there are some people living around there right now that I couldn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
tell you their name. I am always inside. I never go out, you know, but I
have nothing to say against her in any kind of way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She seemed to be industrious and a good mother, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes, sir; she was good to her children, and she kept them
all, you know, nice and clean, but I don't know anything about her business
at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your reaction to the two older boys, John and Robert?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Well, they were like all kids, I guess, you know, having a
good time, but I will say that they were not running like the kids do today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. I mean children back in those days were not like children
are today, and I know, because I have grandchildren now, and they are altogether
different now. Even Lee, he was a good little child, and he didn't do
things like the boys do today. That's why I just can't see how this all came
about. I can't understand it. We didn't even know anything about it until
the man found me, you know. We all thought maybe it was Lee, but we just,
you know, couldn't believe it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall the names of any other children in the neighborhood
who were about the ages of Robert and John?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. No; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would your daughter Cecelia still have a recollection of those
boys, do you think?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. I doubt it, because she was only 8 then. She was small.
My older ones might remember them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be Myra and Emile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes; Myra and Emile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Is there anything else that occurs to you that might
be helpful to the Commission that I haven't asked you about, either because
I don't know about it or I have neglected to ask you about it, or anything you
might want to contribute?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. No; if there was anything else, I would be glad to tell you
about it. Like I say, he was such a little bitty fellow, and after she moved
away we lost track of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After they moved away from there, you never heard of them
and you never saw them until this tragic event occurred, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And even then you didn't believe it was them until, as you said,
the man found you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. I really didn't. Lee was a good little child, and Marguerite
took good care of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. I very much appreciate your coming down with your
husband to talk to us.</p>

<p>Now, these depositions that we are taking will be sent by the U.S. attorney
back to Washington, and you have the privilege, if you wish, to read over your
deposition and to sign it.</p>

<p>You don't have to do that unless you wish, but I would appreciate knowing
what you prefer to do, because if you wish to read your deposition and to sign
it, then we will have to have the reporter write it out promptly and have the
U.S. attorney call you in and then you may come down and read your deposition
and sign it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Well, as far as I can; I have told the truth about everything,
you know, as much as I remember. Like I said, about the ages of the children
and all, I am not positive. This was so long ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I think you were pretty close.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. After 23 years you can't remember like just yesterday, or
the day before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, all right then, as far as you are concerned, you would
just as soon waive the signing of the deposition, is that right? You don't
want to read it over and sign it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Peterman</span>. Yes, sir; I waive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Very well, and thank you again for coming down, Mrs. Peterman.</p>

<h2 id="t45"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_MRS_MYRTLE_EVANS" id="TESTIMONY_OF_MRS_MYRTLE_EVANS">TESTIMONY OF MRS. MYRTLE EVANS</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Mrs. Myrtle Evans was taken on April 7, 1964, at the Old
Civil Courts Building, Royal and Conti Streets, New Orleans, La., by Mr. Albert
E. Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mrs. Myrtle Evans, 1910 Prytania Street, New Orleans, La., after first being
duly sworn, testified as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are Mrs. Myrtle Evans, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your husband is Julian Evans, and he accompanied you here
today, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is waiting outside until you complete your deposition?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Evans, are you a native of New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; he was born in New York, but he was raised in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were born here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have no family, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right. Well, I have no immediate family. I have brothers
and sisters, but I don't have any children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Are you acquainted with a person named Marguerite
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; she was a very good friend of mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you first become acquainted with her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. In about 1930.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About 1930?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was then about 26 or 27 years old, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I guess that's about right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She is either 56 or 57 right now.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, yes; she was about that then, I guess. I had met her
between 1925 and 1930, about that time. I played cards with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What kind of cards? Bridge?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. We played bridge, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you become acquainted with her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, through a friend, a mutual friend&mdash;hers and mine, and we
used to play bridge together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she married then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. She was separated from her first husband.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did she live then, do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I think at that particular time she had a little apartment on
North Carrollton. I never did visit her residence, so I don't know much about
that. At that time she was living with her sister that lived right off of City
Park, but it seems she had a basement apartment on North Carrollton. I don't
think she was living there at that particular time. She did move in with her
sister later, and from time to time she was with her, but at that particular time
I don't think she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What's her sister's name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, I forget.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Murret?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; Mrs. Murret.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lillian Murret?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; her first name is Lillian; yes, that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did that acquaintance continue for some years?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I sort of quit playing cards, and I went and took an accounting
course and went back to work, and I had not seen her for a while, and
she remarried&mdash;to Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You learned of that, did you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; to Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see her from time to time in that interim?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I wasn't playing cards during that time or anything, but I
might have run into her&mdash;I imagine I did, on the street, but I lost contact with
her, sort of, and then&mdash;it was either just before Lee's birth or just after his birth;
I can't remember; it has been so many years, but I met her on the corner of Canal
and St. Charles. I think that was after Lee's birth. I think her husband had
died, and I think she had just taken the baby to the doctor, or something. I
think she told me they had wanted to have a little girl, but I can't remember
all of that just the way it happened, you know. That's been such a long time ago,
but I can remember meeting her; I just can't remember though if it was after
her husband died, or if she was expecting a baby, or if she was the one that
wanted a little girl. I can't remember if that was after the child was born.
Most likely it was that she hoped they would have a little girl. Now, a lot of
this was told to me after we became friends again, as to what happened.</p>

<p>I didn't attend her husband's funeral or anything, and I didn't start seeing
a good deal of her again until&mdash;let's see; she finally went to work downtown,
and I happened to run into her, or something like that. She was working for,
I think, Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., and I was a widow and she was a widow,
and we again sort of regained our friendship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your husband in the meantime had died?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; I am married now to Mr. Evans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your first husband, was he also a native-born American?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, yes; now, I met Lee's aunt one day at a card party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's Mrs. Murret?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, Lillian Murret, and I hadn't seen her in years. I am
Catholic and she is Catholic, you see, and so they had this card party or some
kind of an affair over at the Fontainebleau Motel, and a number of ladies were
present, and it was for charity, and we played bingo and canasta and things,
and she was selling aprons, and so she said, "Oh, Myrtle, did you hear about Lee;
he gave up his American citizenship and went to Russia, behind the iron curtain,"
and I said "My God, no," and she said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Well, after that I didn't hear any more about it. I lost contact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was this, 1959, 1960?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I would say 2 to 3 years ago, about 3 years ago, because I
have been to those affairs, I think, twice since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that the first you knew or had become aware of the fact
that Lee Harvey Oswald was living in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; now, it was undoubtedly in the newspapers and on TV,
but I sometimes get to doing a million things, and I don't get a chance to read the
newspaper. I just skip it. And if I don't get around to it, I skip the news on
TV too, even the late news. So a lot of times I don't know what's going on, but
she said, "Did you hear about Lee?" and I said, "No, what about Lee?" and
she said, "You didn't see it in the paper? Lee has done gone and given up his
United States citizenship," and I said, "Poor Marguerite; that's terrible; I
feel so sorry for her."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You knew Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; I knew him very well. I knew his mother before he was
born, and I knew him since he was a little tyke. Lillian took care of him for a
while, you see. She had two boys, one by her first marriage, and it wasn't her
fault that they got a divorce. He didn't want the child, and he wanted her to
destroy the child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say she had two boys, you are talking about Marguerite
Oswald, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; Marguerite had a terrificly sad life, and she was just a
wonderful, gorgeous wife. She married this John Pic and had his boy, and
he didn't want any children at all, and so she left him and went to live with her
sister, and Oswald, I think, was a Virginia Life Insurance salesman. He collected
insurance from the sister. They lived right off of City Park, and so one day
Margie was strolling with Robert in front of City Park, and Oswald bumped into
them, and he asked them how about him riding them home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say to him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, she let him. You see, he had been collecting insurance at
the house, and had spoken to Margie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At whose house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. At the Murret house, and he had played with the baby. No, let's
see, John was the baby at that time, and she was separated or divorced from her
husband. I forget which now. But he supported John.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean Mr. Pic supported John? You are talking about
John Pic now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; he continued to support him and he sent a baby crib, and he
did everything like that, but he didn't want to live with her because of the child,
so John never did see his father until he was, oh, about 18 years old, or something
like that, so that's why those two boys were so close in age, you see, because
she met Oswald, and he started taking her out. He asked her if she would go
out to dinner with him, and she had been away from her husband for a year and
a half or 2 years, and so she did, and then she married him, and she had this
baby right away, which is Robert, and they bought a home out around Alvar
somewhere. She never told me all this now; some of it I heard from other
sources, like her sister and others, but she did tell me a lot of it, because we got
to be real good friends.</p>

<p>She bought that home, and they had the two boys, and they were very happy,
and then one day he was out mowing the lawn, and he had this terrific pain, and
she was several months pregnant with Lee. She called the doctor right away,
but before the doctor could get there, the man was dead. He had a blood clot,
so he left her with two babies and one on the way.</p>

<p>Now, he left her with $10,000, I think, in insurance, so she sold her home,
and by that time her two boys were old enough, so she put them in this home&mdash;Evangeline,
I think it is, but I'm not sure about that, and she bought a home
over on&mdash;what's the name of that street back off of St. Claude?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Bartholomew?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; I guess that's it. Now, she put the boys in this home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Bethlehem home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, Bethlehem; that's it. That's when I became friendly with
her again. She was living with her sister for a while, and Lee was with her,
and the two older boys were at the home. She was paying her sister board.
But now after her husband died, she went to work, and she had a woman taking
care of the little boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why did she live there, do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. You mean on Bartholomew Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, it was cheaper. She bought a cheaper home. She had
lived on Alvar after she married Oswald. But after Oswald's death she
moved to Bartholomew. Wait a minute&mdash;I might be getting those streets
confused. No, I guess that's right. Anyway, when Oswald died he left her this
$10,000 in insurance, and now I don't know whether the home was completely
paid for or not, but she immediately put these boys in that home and went to
work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it your information that she immediately went to work rather
than try to live for a while without working?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. She might have lived for a month or two, or something, without
working, because I wasn't in contact with her, you see, but she had got this
couple to come and stay with Lee, and someone <span class="locked">said&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What couple was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I don't know what couple it was&mdash;somebody; she had put an ad
in the paper or something&mdash;some young couple. I don't know their names. She
said people told her that when Lee was in the high chair, that he used to cry
a lot, and they thought they were whipping little Lee, so she came home unexpectedly
one night, and the child had welts on his legs, and she told them to
get out and get out now.</p>

<p>So then from there she bought another house and sold that, and&mdash;now, this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
what she told me; she told me that she bought this little double house, and she
ran a sweet shop for a while in the front room there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She told you that she sold that house and bought a double?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, as I recall, she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What's a "double"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's really two houses, side by side; you have a door here and
a door here, two entrances. They call them flats or duplexes some places, but
we call them doubles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. O.K. I just wanted to make sure the record is clear on that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. She bought that little house, and they moved in there with her
three children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that over at 831 Pauline Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, that sounds like the address. I never went there myself.
I don't even know where Pauline Street is, to tell you the truth. It's downtown
some place. Then she left there, and Lee, I think, still was with the aunt,
and the two boys were down at the other place&mdash;that home, and she got this
job managing the hosiery store on Canal Street, and that's when I started
seeing her again, and that was between 1939 and 1940, somewhere in there;
around in there&mdash;the early 1940's, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At that time she was living where now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. She was living with her sister then, I think, and Lee was with
her, and the two boys were boarding at the Bethlehem Home. She would go
down on Sundays to see her two boys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did she remain with her sister?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I don't know how long she had been with her sister, but
after she took this position, she finally went to Texas, and I don't know&mdash;I
couldn't tell you how long, because I just started seeing her, well, we would
see each other on Saturday afternoon or Sunday, something like that, you know,
just go around a bit together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How old was Lee at about that time, about 3 or 2, or what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. He was 3 or 4 years old then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He eventually was placed in the Bethlehem Home also, wasn't
he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, she might have finally got him in, because her sister, as
you know, had a big family of her own, and I think maybe she might have finally
put him in there too.</p>

<p>You see, they only take them at these places after a certain age, generally
about three, I think. They have to be trained and all, and that's why Lee was
always with her before that, and all her love, I think, she dumped on Lee after
her husband died.</p>

<p>You know, she felt awful sorry for Lee, because he never knew his father.
He was born after his father died, and he was his baby, and she always sort
of felt sorry for Lee for that reason, I think, and sort of leaned toward Lee.
She felt sorry for Lee because he never knew his father, I think, just as any
mother would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we have information that from sometime in 1939 to 1941,
she resided on Alvar Street in New Orleans; does that square with your
recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, Alvar, that was where she had her home, wasn't it, on
Alvar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I was told it was in that subdivision.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you recall her selling that house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; she told me she sold it, but I wasn't too friendly with her
at the time, and I didn't know anything about that. I was working, and I didn't
play cards then, you see.</p>

<p>She was a friend of a friend of mine actually, that I played cards with, and
I wasn't too friendly with the girl at first, but only through cards, but at the
time I was sorry for her when I first learned what her husband had done to
her, but later on I lost contact with her all the way up till just about the time
she went to Texas, or maybe it was about a year before she went to Texas. It's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
hard to recall those dates, to tell what year this happened and what year that
happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would have been around 1945, or 1944, somewhere in there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; along in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall her living on Atlantic Avenue in Algiers, La.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Atlantic Avenue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do recall a period when her two older boys, John and
Robert, were in the Bethlehem Orphans School?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, yes; I went there once with her, in fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At that time she was with the Murrets, is that right, Mrs. Evans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then she moved to Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With her children, of course?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What occurred about that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. She married again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She married, and was that why she moved to Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's why. She married a very, very fine man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall what his name was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. You know it; I will give it to you&mdash;Ekdahl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know how to spell that, Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I don't remember, but I knew her during that period all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you become acquainted with him, Mr. Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What kind of man was he, Mrs. Evans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. He was very high caliber, a very fine man, and he had a very
fine position. The papers said she was dragged from pillar to post, but that
wasn't true. It was his work that took them to places. That's why she went
to New York, because of his position. He didn't drag her from pillar to post
at all. I don't know what happened to them then, because I didn't see them
again. He died, and that's when she moved back to New Orleans, and they
stayed in my apartment building. Now, I visited her in Dallas, and I knew
Eddie Ekdahl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you know Mr. Ekdahl before he married her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was his second marriage, isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; so she said. He had been separated from his wife for
many years, but had never gotten a divorce, I don't think, so then he did get
a divorce and married Margie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember where he was from originally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Boston, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it your recollection that they moved to Dallas, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. They did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you visit them in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that address 4801 Victor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I don't remember that, because I went there with a friend of
mine, to the Baker Hotel, I think it was. I used to go around with this friend
of mine. She was with Mary Douglas Perfumes, and Margie was living there
with her husband at the time, and the two children, when I visited her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Her husband and her two children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, her three children, I mean, were with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Including Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; I went and stayed a few days with her, but the address I
don't remember. We didn't correspond during those years, but that could have
been the address. It was a duplex, I know, and she lived downstairs, and she
rented out the upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At that time Lee was around 6 years old, is that right?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; just about at the kindergarten stage. Let's see&mdash;yes, she
lived downstairs, and she rented out the upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you visited there, were the two boys, John and Robert,
living at the home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; they all lived together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Lee, too?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The nature of Mr. Ekdahl's work was such that he had to
travel, you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, yes; he had to do a lot of traveling. I think he was a
geologist; that's what my husband said he was. He was with some big company
that he was top man with, and he was a good deal older than Margie, and a
very fine, handsome, big man, but he had a blood clot, and that's how they got
to be married as quick as they did, because of that. You see, he was at the
Roosevelt Hotel, and he had nobody, and he had this blood clot and everything,
and at that time he was taking Margie out, and he wasn't too well a man because
of this blood clot and all, but he wanted to marry Margie, and so she married
him, and they went from Dallas to, I think, San Antonio, and then I think they
went to New York, and sometime after that, of course, Margie came down here,
and she took an apartment with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before we get into that, Mrs. Evans, if you don't mind, let's go
back a bit and see if I have this clear in my mind. You say you visited them
once in Texas, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Other than that visit, you had no contact with her, that is,
visually, in person, while she was in Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; I didn't. Now, after she was married to Ekdahl and went
to Covington, she had her other two boys with her. This was in the summertime,
of course. She had them in the boarding school over there, even after she
married Ekdahl, this was. She kept Lee with her all the time she was married
to Ekdahl, of course, so that they would all three be together on these business
trips he had to take, and they would stay in the best hotels, of course, and they
had the best of everything, but that didn't seem to work out too well, having
Lee with them all the time like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was when she was married to Mr. Ekdahl, that she had
the boys over at Covington?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes. Her two older sons were in boarding school, and in the
summer they would all be together over at this place in Covington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this in 1946?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I don't know just what year that would have been, but
I would say it was around there. I don't remember the exact years for a lot
of this stuff, but I can just tell you the way I remember it happening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's all right. Just go on the way you have been. The
pieces will all fit together eventually, and that's what the Commission wants
before it brings this investigation to its conclusion.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I have had so many people pass through my life, it would take
something to remember all of those details.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see the boys during that period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, yes; she would visit me for about 3 or 4 days, I remember
one time, and Lee was about 7 years old then. He was a little fellow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your impression of Lee as of that time, Mrs. Evans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I would say Lee was a spoiled little boy, because naturally
his mother kept him, and I think Margie would have had a better life if she
had put him in boarding school with the other two boys, because then she
would have lived with Ekdahl. I understand they were separated and divorced
before he died, but you know how a mother can throw her entire life on a
child and spoil that child and let the child ruin her life for her, and Margie
clung to Lee regardless, but in that respect she was a wonderful mother. You
couldn't find a better woman. Of course, when she married Ekdahl, she didn't
want him to support her children. She tried to support them herself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was her own decision?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, yes; it was her decision. She wanted Ekdahl to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
her and Lee, and she kept Lee with them all the time, and I think that's one
of the things that contributed to their divorce. She was too close to Lee all
the time, and I don't guess Ekdahl liked that too much.</p>

<p>Now, when Margie lived in Dallas, she kept her three boys with her, but
after she married Ekdahl, she put the two boys in boarding school, and she
still kept Lee with them. Of course, they had to leave Dallas on these trips
that Mr. Ekdahl made in connection with his work, but Lee would be with them
every time, and like I said, it hurt their marriage because they never could
be alone. Lee was spoiled. He was just a spoiled boy. I'll put it this way:
He was her baby, and she loved him to death, and she spoiled him to death.
One of the older boys, or maybe both of them&mdash;I don't remember, but I think
they both went into the <span class="locked">Marines&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, one of them went into the Coast Guard.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, they went into the service, and both of her older boys
were very, very fine boys. John Pic was a lovely boy, but of course he never
did see his father. His father never did care to see the child, the way I understand
it, and at 18 I think he quit supporting him, or something like that. Now,
when Margie decided to come back to New Orleans, I think she came here from
San Antonio or Fort Worth, one of those places, and she went to her <span class="locked">sister's&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you wait a minute now, ma'am? Was Marguerite working
at that time, either in Texas, or did she go to work after she came back
to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, she might have tried her hand at real estate at one time,
and of course she had worked in different department stores, and at the time I
caught up with her and ran into her, I think she said she was working then
for the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. She said she answered a blind ad in the
paper, and she got this job, and she opened Jean's Hoisery Shop, and that's
when we would meet and go to lunch on a Saturday afternoon, and we got to
be friendly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were working at that time also?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, sir; I was in the government then. I am an accountant,
and I was with the government. We would meet, like on Thursday evenings
and have dinner, and shop around, and on Saturday afternoon, usually at
those times, and we became pretty friendly again, but then of course she went
back to Texas.</p>

<p>I used to travel with this friend of mine who was with Mary Douglas Perfumes,
and she traveled out of California, and she was going to be in Dallas
for a show&mdash;some kind of display show, I guess it was, and I went with her,
and during that trip I guess I stayed about a week with Margie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What kind of housekeeper was Margie?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. A very good housekeeper, very tasty; she could take anything
and make something out of it, and something beautiful. She had a lot of
natural talent that way, and she was not lazy. She would work with things
by the hour for her children, and she kept a very neat house, and she was
always so lovely herself. That's why, when I saw her on TV, after all of
this happened, she looked so old and haggard, and I said, "That couldn't be
Margie," but of course it was, but if you had known Margie before all this
happened, you would see what I mean. She was beautiful. She had beautiful
wavy hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, Lee was a smart boy. He was no dummy. He was a bit
of a bookworm, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me more about that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, he had hair like his mother for example, but he was a
loner. That's what the children all said, but of course, I didn't pay too much
attention to that, but he didn't bring boys in the house, I mean, and he would
always seem to prefer being by himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He wouldn't bring boys into the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; he never did, that I know of. He would come home, and
he would get his books and his music, and then when he wanted supper, or
something to eat, he would scream like a bull. He would holler, "Maw, where's
my supper?" Some of the time Margie would be downstairs talking to me or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
something, and when he would holler at her, she would jump up right away
and go and get him something to eat. Her whole life was wrapped up in that
boy, and she spoiled him to death. Lee was about 13 about that time, I think,
along in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this while he was living with his mother at one of your
apartments?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, this was the last time I knew anything about Lee, when
they lived at my apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this after or before she had gone to New York City?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, this was all after her trip to New York. She wasn't with
Ekdahl any more when she came back here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wonder if you would hold that for a minute now. I would
like to have you give me your impression of Lee up to the time they returned
from New York?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I couldn't give you too much about the child, because I
didn't know him too much. He seemed just like a normal boy. I mean, he
didn't seem to be any different than his brothers, as far as that goes, but
the way he kept to himself just wasn't normal, I don't think. I guess that's
why they called him a loner, because he was alone so much. He didn't seem
to want to be with any other children. Now, when she was over in Covington
in the summer months, she would be there the full 3 months, I think, and
they seemed to be a very happy family. They would go swimming and eat watermelon,
and they had a couple of dogs, I think, in the backyard, and they would
just have a good time. I would say they were really a happy family in those
days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were a happy family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. As far as I could see, they were very happy, very closely knit,
very much in love with each other, and these boys knew that their mother
was putting them through school, and giving them what they needed, as best
she could. She was a very good provider for her children, and a very decent
woman. I mean, she wasn't a loose woman at all. She was very decent,
a very fine woman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, that squares with everything we have found. I don't
think any mother could do more than she did for them, as far as we have
been able to find out.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right. Nobody could have done any more for their children
than she did, I mean, with what she had to work with. She was never
well off, I mean, financially. She always worked and saved and made do the
best she could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When she moved to New York City, did you lose touch with
Margie then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; I lost complete touch with Margie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you hear from her while she was in New York?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; I don't think so. She might have written me a postal
card or something, but I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then the first time that you again began seeing her was when
she came back to New Orleans, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you hear from her or hear about her while she was living
in Texas, before she went to New York?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, yes; like I said, I was over there in Dallas with her for
a week, and I kept pretty well in touch with what she was doing. For a time
she lived&mdash;what's the name of that little town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you mean Benbrook?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. It could have been that. Anyway, I heard from her again,
that she was traveling a lot with her husband. She was still living with
Ekdahl then. They were living in hotels and traveling, and Lee was right
with them all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She kept Lee with her on all these trips with Mr. Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. As far as I know, she did, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As far as you know, did she have Lee with her all the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I don't think that she ever parted with Lee for a minute. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
she did, I don't know about it, but when she came back, the way she talked,
I figured that Lee was with them the whole time, and they had lived in
hotels and things like that while Mr. Ekdahl was traveling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall when her marriage to Ekdahl took place, Mrs.
Evans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, it was when she went to Texas, just about at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Around 1945, would that have been, in maybe 1944?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Along in there; yes. She married him, I think, in Dallas, Tex.,
or maybe it was Fort Worth. I can't recall that for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But he had been here in New Orleans, and that's when they
struck up this acquaintanceship, here in New Orleans, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She said that he had had a heart attack, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he was courting her during this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His sister came down from Boston, is that right, to sort of see
how he was getting along here, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right. I guess that's what prompted her to come down
here, because he had had this trouble, and I guess she was concerned about
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that courtship between him and Marguerite ripened into
marriage then; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Ekdahl's sister approve of Marguerite?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, yes; she wanted her to marry Ekdahl, and before she went
back to Boston, Margie made her a promise that she would look after him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then Margie moved to Texas with Mr. Ekdahl; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you say you visited them over there, in Dallas; is that
right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you think you might have heard from her at different times
when she was traveling with her husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right&mdash;you know, postal cards and such.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then you didn't hear from her for a while; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then you said you heard from her again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you give me the circumstances of that now, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, she called me, most likely. She was at her sister's. She
was looking for an apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, but when you say "her sister's," who do you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Lillian Murret. She had only that one sister here. She was a
good many years older than Margie. Margie was the baby of the family. She
took care of her father, that is, until his death, and she kept house for her
father, too. I guess there is about 10 years difference between the two. That's
why I guess they have not been too close. But anyway, she called me and
asked about an apartment, and I told her I could give her an apartment, and
that I would let her have it cheaper than I would somebody else that I didn't
know. Now, they didn't have any furniture, but there were a few pieces left
in the apartment, and her sister provided some things and I found a few
things for her, so she made out with that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember what year that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I remodeled that apartment about 10 years ago, so I
would say that that was around 1954, along in there, in the early spring, I
think it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the early spring?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, it might have been a little later. It could have been in
May or June of 1954, but possibly a little earlier than that. I can't remember
that well enough to be definite on the month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where was this apartment?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. 1454 St. Mary Street, apartment 6, but now finally Margie decided
that she couldn't afford that apartment, and moved, despite the fact that
I was renting it to her for less than I would have anybody else, and I told her
that.</p>

<p>She came in one day and told me, "Myrtle, I am going to give the apartment
up." She told me that she had seen a house out around St. Bernard that would
be cheaper. She said she had rode around and looked at the house, and she
thought that she would take it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She had an automobile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; she rode the bus out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She had no complaints about your apartment, did she? She
just had found a cheaper place to move to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, she was perfectly happy in the apartment. She said she
liked it, but that she just couldn't afford it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who else was in the apartment besides Marguerite?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Just her and Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did see Lee after they returned from New York?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, yes; they lived at my house for, oh, I guess about 6 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Including Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She and Lee lived in your home for 6 months?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. In this apartment, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the No. 6 apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; you see, I had this great big house with about 27 rooms
or more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was just one big building; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; but it was converted into modern apartments, and they
took one of them, you see&mdash;one of the smaller apartments. I had had one
tenant prior to her, so she was the second tenant in this little apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was at 1454 St. Mary Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So she and her son Lee occupied that apartment for approximately
6 months, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was in 1954, you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; maybe not exactly that year, but along about there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you get to see both of them frequently?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Practically every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, tell me about this period while they lived at
your home. Just transport yourself back to 10 years ago. What did Lee Oswald
look like?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. What did he look like?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; and what did he do? What impression did he make on you
then, not what you heard, but what you remember now about him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, he was more spoiled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. More than before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; he had gotten older, and he wanted his way, and he was a
teenager then, and like all teenagers, he was very difficult. Of course, I guess
all teenagers are that way, because they are not yet grown and they are not a
child either. The best of them are very trying, and it is hard to keep them in
line. In that respect Lee wasn't any different than any other teenaged boy,
I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, this was the period after which Lee returned from New
York; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; after they came here from New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With his mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did they say to you as to why they returned from New
York and came to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I don't know that they said anything, but it seems to me
now that they came right from Texas over to New Orleans then, not right from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
New York. I could be mistaken there, but I think they went back to Texas
from New York.</p>

<p>Maybe they did come right from New York, but I can't remember that far back.
I know that they had divorced, and although no one told me, I just put two and
two together, and it was my opinion that Lee evidently was just so spoiled and
demanded so much of his mother's attention that they didn't get along&mdash;I mean,
her and Ekdahl, because of Lee. Now, that's my opinion. She never told me
why.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's just your surmise?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, sir; I can't help feeling that if she had put Lee in a boarding
school, she might have hung onto her meal ticket, and considering Mr. Ekdahl's
condition and everything, if all that hadn't happened, she would have been
sitting on top of the world. She wouldn't have had another worry in her life,
as far as money goes, but instead her children came first, I mean, Lee. She
just poured out all her love on him, it seemed like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she ever say anything to you about her experiences in New
York City?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She never said anything to you that would have given you an
indication as to whether she had come from New York rather than Texas, or
vice versa?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; not that I recall, but it is my distinct feeling that she stayed
in New York awhile and then moved to Texas again, and then over to New
Orleans&mdash;Fort Worth, I think, but I can't say that for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say anything to you about any trouble that Lee had had
in school in New York City?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; she never did. But I knew Ekdahl, and I knew he was a
man that was set in his ways. He was older than Margie, and he wanted,
evidently, a wife. He wanted her to be with him evidently, and if you've got
a kid dragging behind, you know it makes a difference, but now whether that
caused the break or not, I don't know. I couldn't tell you that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The point I am getting at is, she didn't say anything to you about
any problem or difficulties she had had with Lee in New York City?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. None whatever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were aware that she had been in New York City, of course?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But she didn't say anything to you about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, at that time Lee was about 15 years old; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. He was, somewhere around there&mdash;maybe 13 or 14. I don't know
exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At any rate, you had a period here of several years between the
time you saw him and he lived in your apartment with his mother, and the time
you had previously seen him, so could you compare what he was like and how he
acted when you saw him in 1954, as against when you had seen him before that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, like I said, he was more spoiled than he was when he was
younger. He was just a little boy when I first saw him, and this time he was
quite grown up, a teenager, like I said, so I would say he was a lot more difficult
this time to understand or control than he was when he was younger.</p>

<p>The main thing that seems to stand out in his conduct was the way he demanded
to be fed when he would come from school. Margie would be downstairs
maybe, talking to me or something, and he would come to the head of the stairs
and yell for her to come up and fix him something to eat. He would just stand
up there and yell, "Maw, how about fixing me something to eat?" and she would
jump up right away and go running upstairs to get something for him.</p>

<p>Now, he liked records. He didn't want to see any television, but he would
lock himself up in his bedroom sometimes and play these records, and listen to
the radio, and read. He was a hard one to try to figure out. But other than
that, he was, I would say, just an average, spoiled teenage kid that wanted what
he wanted. There are very few of them that aren't that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say he was more spoiled than the average teenager?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, he was spoiled maybe more because he didn't have a father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
to pull him down a bit. When you are raising a child alone, it's a hard row&mdash;I
mean, with just the mother, because, you know, they are getting bigger all the
time, and a woman can't keep control over them like a man can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean physically?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; physically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she register him in school here in New Orleans when they
came to live in your apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I don't know who registered him. That I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But he did go to school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, yes; he went to school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which school was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That was Beauregard, and I might say that she used her sister's
address so she could get him in that school. It's a good school, and she wanted
him to go there, and also at that time I believe she was living with her sister,
so that was in that school district. That's the way I understand it anyway. I
think there has been some confusion about that address that was given at the
school, but it is my understanding that that's why she used it. If she hadn't
used her sister's address, he couldn't have gone to Beauregard probably, I mean,
if she had moved to another district. So since she wanted him in Beauregard,
that was the easiest way to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In order to get him in Beauregard, she used her sister's address,
and that was the reason, as you understand it; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; that was a good school. I guess it still is, but she wanted
him in there. Otherwise he would have had to go to another school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's Beauregard Junior High School; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; and, like I said, a good school; a very fine school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Lee a good student, according to information you received
in that regard, if you did receive any such information?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I never saw his report cards, but I think he was a pretty
good student. I really couldn't tell you that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you notice during this period that you had this recent, close
acquaintanceship with him, that he was still retiring, and that he was inclined to
be by himself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; he liked books, and he liked music, and he would come home
from school, of course, a couple of hours before Margie, and he would have crossword
puzzles and books and music, and he seemed to entertain himself very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He didn't go out and play with the other children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, they had this change in 1955 from 1454 to 1452 St. Mary.
Was that in the same building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that a different apartment, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I will tell you what happened there. There was this young couple
that wanted that apartment, and I still hear from them. She sold them her
furniture. They were the tenants after her, and she sold them some of the
things in the apartment, because at that time she told me she was going to take
this house way up on the other side of town, and she came back the next day
and told me that she changed her mind and wanted her apartment back, but I
told her that I had already rented her apartment to this young couple. I said,
"Margie, what happened to the house you were going to get?" and she said, "I
looked it over," and she said, "It's too far from a grocery store. I have no way
of getting my groceries; too many blocks to walk, and it's too inconvenient."</p>

<p>I told her, "Well, I've already rented the apartment to this young couple,"
and she said, "I want to keep my apartment," and I said, "But, Margie, I have
rented the apartment already, and you even sold them some furniture," and she
said, "Well, they can have the furniture," but she said, "Just tell them you can't
let them have the apartment; that I have got to keep it."</p>

<p>Well, that was how we sort of fell out, was over this deal. I told her, I said,
"Margie, I just can't do that." To tell you the truth, the way Lee was acting up
and all&mdash;he was very noisy, I didn't particularly want to do it. I knew, in the
first place, that the girl simply couldn't afford it, and it would be just a matter of
months until she would be behind in her rent and everything. I think she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
already about a month in arrears on the rent, and I just figured it would be
better if I didn't give her the apartment back, so I told her that I couldn't do it,
because I had already rented it to this couple. I knew that, even if she could
pay the rent for that month, it would be just a matter of time until she couldn't
make it, and she would be struggling all the time and trying to make it, and it
would maybe be more hard feelings if I let it go on that way, so I decided that
it would be better to let it go the way it was going. It seemed to be the best
way out of it. I thought we would be better friends maybe if they would go
ahead and move now, rather than later, so I told her, I said, "Margie, if you
want, you can move next door, and it will be a little cheaper," and so, they did
move next door. Now, I had told her that I was going to fix up that little
apartment she had occupied, just to sort of let her down easy&mdash;you know, have
it painted, and so forth, so she went ahead and moved next door for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that 1452 St. Mary; this place next door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; right next door. You see&mdash;I think I have skipped something.
I told her that I wanted to get the apartment that she had been in fixed
up, and that's how I talked her into taking the place next door, but then she
started complaining and saying I was charging her too much rent for this place
next door, and I wasn't getting the apartment fixed up that she had been in,
and in the meantime Lee had gotten to the point where he was noisier and more
determined with his mother, and it was getting a little unbearable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you mean, he was getting "more determined?" In what
respects was he more determined?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, he would yell, "Maw, come and fix my supper," and he had
a loud voice, and I could hear him more and more up there, and it got to be
quite disturbing, actually. It seemed to be a situation that was getting worse
all the time; so I thought maybe it would be better if I didn't have them around;
so, since the apartment wasn't fixed up anyway, and she wasn't very happy
next door, she up and moved, and that's when she went to Exchange Alley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. O.K. That was in April of 1955; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, and I never saw her after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You never saw her again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't see her at Exchange Alley?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She never came to visit you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; she was angry about the apartment, because I made her
give it up. I mean I wouldn't give it back to her after she moved away. I
don't think she ever got over that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She didn't come to visit you any more at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; she didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She didn't get in touch with you at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was the next time you heard from or heard about, Margie
or Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. The next thing I heard, they had moved back to Texas. They
had left town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did you hear that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, her sister, Lillian, I saw her in Holmes or&mdash;let's see, maybe
it was at the Fontainbleau, at a card party we were having&mdash;yes; I think that
was it; she asked me if I had seen Margie, and I said, "No; I haven't seen or
heard from Margie," and that's when she told me that she had heard Margie
had moved back to Texas. I didn't know that at all. I had heard from several
people that they had seen Margie downtown. She worked at three or four different
places&mdash;you know, hosiery, and so forth, and someone would run into
me every once in a while that I knew, and would say they had seen Margie
downtown at some store or other, but I didn't see her, and then the next thing
I knew she was supposed to be back in Texas, and then I ran into Lillian again
later and she told me&mdash;this was at the Fontainbleau. Now, I have that straight.
She told me then about the trouble Lee was in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did you run into Lillian at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. At a benefit card party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At the Fontainbleau?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what did Lillian tell you about Lee on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. She told me that Lee was in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That Lee had defected to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then, when was the next thing you heard about any of the
Oswald family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, that was when Lee came to town, and they took an apartment
up on Magazine Street. I can't remember that date now, but Lee got here
a day or two before his wife came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would that have been in May of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I don't remember the date, but it seems like it was about
the middle of May; maybe about May 16, or somewhere close to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that when he took the apartment at 4905 Magazine Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes. Was that May 16?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; I think it was a little earlier than that, according to our
information.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, whatever date that was, that was the next time I saw him.
I don't know if it was April or May, or even March; I don't know what date it
was, but I got the apartment for him, and he moved in on the day he rented it,
or the next day, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He moved in on the 10th; would that be about right; the day
after he rented the apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, if he rented it on the 9th, then that would be about right.
He moved in the day after, I think it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the 9th of May?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I guess so; yes. That's when I saw him, on the 9th of May, and
then he moved in on the 10th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me the circumstances that led to his renting that apartment,
Mrs. Evans.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, the doorbell rang, and my husband hadn't gone to work.
He says he recognized him then, but I don't remember it that way, but anyway
this young man was at the door, and he said he wanted an apartment, and did
I have an apartment to rent, and I didn't have anything in this building, but
I told him about another building I was fixing up, and I told him I might be
able to find something for him, and he told me he had a wife and child over in
Texas, and that he was going to bring them over here as soon as he could find
an apartment, and that he had to find something right now. He said, "I want
something right away."</p>

<p>When we were walking down the steps, I looked at him real hardlike, and I
didn't recognize him, but something made me ask him, "I know you, don't I?"
and he said, "Sure; I am Lee Oswald; I was just waiting to see when you were
going to recognize me." I said, "Lee Oswald, what are you doing in this
country? I thought you were in Russia. I thought you had given up your
American citizenship and gone behind the Iron Curtain," and he said, "No,"
he said, "I went over there," he said, "but I didn't give up my citizenship." He
said he had been back in the States for quite a while, and that he had brought
his Russian wife back with him; so I told him I would help him look for a place;
so I rang up this friend of mine, and I asked her, I said, "Vickie, do you happen
to know where I can rent an apartment for a young couple with one little
baby?" and she said, "Yes; Myrtle, I will take children. This is a little duplex,"
she said, and she said, "This is a nice little apartment, and I think they will
like it," and I said, "How much?" and she said, "$65," and I said, "Well, he
can't spend too much; he is just getting a new job."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What's her name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Mrs. Maynard&mdash;Vickie Maynard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know her husband's first name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Charles&mdash;Charlie Maynard. She only saw him for about 15
minutes; she has no bearing on this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. So she said, "Myrtle, bring him over, and I'll see you in about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
10 minutes," and I said, "We'll come up and see it," so we got in the car and
went up and looked at it, but it wasn't too impressive. It was an upper, and
they had no laundry facilities, or anything. They did have a little spare room
that he could have made into a nursery for the baby, but Lee wasn't satisfied
with it after we looked at it. He told me that he would rather get something
on the first floor, and with laundry facilities, having the baby and all, so I
said, "Well, come on, Lee; I don't know anybody that will take children," I
said, "but we will just ride up and down the streets and see what we can find."
So we rode in and out and all around Baronne and Napoleon and Louisiana
Avenue, and Carondelet, you know, just weaving in and out the streets, and
looking for any signs of apartments for rent, so we finally rode down Magazine
Street, and I said, "You might as well get as close to your work as possible
if you are going to get an apartment."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you learned in the meantime that he had a job with the
Reily Coffee Co.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes. He told me that he had just got a job with the Reily Coffee
Co., and that he wanted his wife to come over here. In fact, he was going to
phone her to come over that Saturday, I believe he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say what kind of job he had with Reily?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; he just told me he was going to work for the Reily Coffee
Co., and that he had been staying at Lillian's, and that he was anxious for his
wife to come to New Orleans, and he said a friend was going to drive her over
here; so we were coming down Magazine Street, and all of a sudden he said,
"Oh, there's a sign," and I said, "Good," so I pulled up around the corner,
and we got out and read the sign, and then we went up and rang the doorbell,
and they showed us two apartments, and this one apartment was very good
for the money.</p>

<p>It was really the most for your money, I'd say, so I said, "Lee," I said, "this
is a very nice apartment for the money; you can't afford too much," and I said,
"This is the best you can do," and I said, "If I were you, I would take it," and
it had a living room that was a tremendous room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Larger than this room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, no; not quite that wide, but really long, and they had a
bedroom here, and a kitchen that went this way, in other words, and it had
a front screened porch, and a yard, and the yard was long, and it had a Page
fence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What kind of fence was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. A Page fence&mdash;an iron fence, like they use around New Orleans.
You may call them storm fences, but down here they call them Page fences.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Can you see through them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, yes; it's just that a child couldn't get in the street. I mean
they are good fences, but they are not solid. You can see through them&mdash;these
sort of diagonals, I guess you would call them. Now, the people that ran the
place that he rented it from were sort of caretakers. She lived on one side,
and she ran the apartment on the other side that they rented.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was her name; the lady who lived next door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I don't know. I had her phone number and her name, and I was
going to call her&mdash;I did call her once that I remember, but, nevertheless, I
told Lee to give her the money for the gas and light, in other words, the deposit,
so she could get the electricity turned on, because he wanted his wife to come
for Saturday. I think this must have been about Wednesday or Thursday that
we were there. He said it would be night before they got there, because this
friend of his wife, who talked Russian, was going to bring her over to New
Orleans, and bring the baby bed, bring everything, and that way, with the extra
room and everything, that the lady could stay overnight, this friend of his wife,
so we went on back and got in the car and rode on home, and I think I went
out and got some luncheon meat and some things, and I think I ran to the
grocery store, too, and got a pound of ham and some stuff, and we sat and ate
lunch, and he drank a coke, I think, and we talked, and I asked him, I said,
"Well, how does it feel to be back in New Orleans?" and he said, "I have wanted
to move back to New Orleans." He said, "New Orleans is my home," and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
said, "I felt like I just wanted to come back," and he said, "You know, I like
the old high ceilings and the trees and the French Quarter, and everything in
New Orleans," and he said, "You know, in Russia the buildings are brand new,"
and we talked a little about Russia&mdash;not too much, but he did tell me how men
over in Russia can't rent an apartment if they are not married; that they have
to live in rooms, so many men to a room; that you have to be married to have
an apartment; and he said that they were all modern, and they are given
to you by the Government, but that you can only have an apartment if you are
married; so we talked some more about Russia, and about him giving up his
citizenship and things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me what he said about giving up his citizenship. I want to
hear all about that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. What he told me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; what did he say about defecting to Russia; anything he said
about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. He said he didn't give up his American citizenship; that that was
ridiculous. He told me that he just wanted to see the country over there, and
he had gotten work over there, and that he had fallen in love with this girl, and
we talked about the difference in the housing here and over there, and he told me
that they didn't pay any rent, and they had a modern apartment, I think, about
on the fourth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say it was only one room; that there was only one room to
this apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, he said they had a living room, a bedroom, a dining room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that what he said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; he said they had a nice place to live over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He said that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; he told me it was an apartment, but he said he had to live
with other men in one room prior to the time he was married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When he said apartment, you assumed that he meant several
rooms&mdash;a bedroom, kitchen, and so forth; isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you don't know that, do you, Mrs. Evans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, no; I don't know that. I have never been to Russia. All I
know is what he told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But do you remember him distinctly telling you that his apartment
had all of these rooms?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; I don't remember that. He just said it was a modern apartment.
I remember him saying that. It could have been just one room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It could have been one room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, like I say, I just don't know. He said it was a modern
apartment, but other than that I don't know what else he said, I mean, whether
he described it any more than that or not, or whether I even asked him any more
about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But he did use the word "apartment," is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; he said they had an apartment; I remember that very
plainly, and he said it was modern, but other than that I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But he didn't describe the apartment, as far as you can recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right; I don't remember him doing that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he didn't deny at any time to you that he had attempted to
defect, but that he had failed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; he said he never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say he had not attempted to defect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, he said that he did not want to give up his American
citizenship, and that he never intended to do so. He said, "I am an American,"
and he said, "I just went over there, just messing around."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he express to you then or at any subsequent time his opinion
of Russia and his reaction to the life he had in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, he didn't seem to think they had treated him too bad. I
guess he was just a young man in love with this Russian girl, but he did say now
that he had decided not to come back to the States until he could bring her with
him. He did say that, so from that conversation I gathered that he evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
wanted to come back, but he had married into a Russian family, and he had to
get out the best way he could.</p>

<p>Now, this Russian woman, I don't know if she was Russian born or not, but the
paper said that this woman was a teacher, and that she taught Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean Mrs. Paine? You are talking about Mrs. Paine now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; I didn't even remember her name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean the lady that brought Marina over to New Orleans from
Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; the one that brought Marina and the baby to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, we will get into that in a minute, Mrs. Evans; she's not a
Russian woman, by the way. She's a girl from Columbus, Ohio, that was a
Quaker.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, she did speak Russian, and she was the lady friend of
Marina that was going to bring Marina and the baby to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, that's right; she does speak Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. He told me that his wife didn't speak American.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say why she didn't speak English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Why she didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; did he give you any reason for that, why she wasn't learning
the English language since she was living over here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; he didn't say anything about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What impression did you have of Lee as of that visit, Mrs. Evans,
because you were with him for quite a while there on this apartment hunting
tour? What did you think of Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, he was, I would say, sort of arrogant. He seemed to think
of himself as being sort of apart from everybody else, and he carried himself so
straight, and the way he had of avoiding people, and keeping within himself, and,
you know, not talking too much&mdash;I noticed all that. I asked him how his mother
was, and he said his mother was fine, and I asked him about his brothers, because
his brothers were both in Texas, and I believe one of them has a child or two,
or something like that, and he said as far as he knew they were all right. We
were just sort of talking, you might say, on the surface. You know how you do,
riding along, and all the time looking for something&mdash;like we were looking for
apartment signs. We were getting out and looking, and getting back in, and
just driving around looking and talking about things in general.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you used the expression "arrogant." What did you mean
by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, you know&mdash;I don't know, just the way he talked, and walked
around, I guess. I don't know what gives you that feeling when you are
around somebody like that. He was just different.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you think he considered himself superior to anybody else,
or to his fellow Americans, or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I wouldn't say he acted like he was superior to anybody
else. He acted normal in that respect, I guess, but he talked about Russia
and he talked about the way they lived, and then he said, "It's good to be back
in the United States," and he said he would have come back before he did if it
had not been for this Russian girl that he married. He said he had been in
Texas 8 months then, and I said, "Well, what made you come back to New
Orleans?" and he said, "Well, you know, this is my home, and I wanted to see
my family."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Oswald family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes. He said he wanted to see if he could locate any of his
family, that he didn't know who any of them were any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything at all as to whether he was happy or unhappy
in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; he didn't say anything about that, except he said he would
have come back sooner if he hadn't married this girl, and he had to wait until
he could bring her out of the country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything about having been in the service?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; he didn't say anything about that, but I found that out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything about what his ambitions were, what his
objectives were in life now that he was back home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he have any luggage with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Not when he came to my house. He said he had been staying
at his aunt's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he talk about any of his old friends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When he was a teenager, did he ever smoke?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever know him to smoke?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or drink?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say he was temperate with respect to smoking?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; he was very deep; a very deep boy, and he liked to dig into
things, and he liked music and books.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say he was a voracious reader?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; he liked to read, and he liked to listen to the radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What kind of music drew his attention, classics?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, symphony&mdash;more of the highbrow stuff, I guess you would
say. I don't really remember because this was so many years ago, and I didn't
go up to their apartment that much, you know; she would come down to my
apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who would?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. His mother, but I know he liked to listen to his records a lot,
and he had a lot of books all over the place, you know. His mother would come
downstairs in the evening sometime, you know, and we would sit and talk, and
sometimes even when she would just come in from work, she would have dinner
with me, or something like that, and that's the way it was with Margie and
me until we had this sort of falling out, I guess you would call it.</p>

<p>Then after they moved to Texas, like I said, I didn't hear from them for
quite awhile, and then Lee came back and came to the house, and we did all
of that apartment hunting until we found him one, and then after he had
moved in, he called me one day and wanted to know if I could come up and
meet Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long was this after he had moved into the apartment, can
you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, I'd say about a week or so, and anyway I thought it would
be nice to go up and meet Marina, and I told him we would try to come up,
because I would like to meet his wife, and he said, "Just come anytime." He
said she was anxious to meet me. Well, of course, I was busy, so I didn't go,
so one night while we were sitting and looking at television here his face comes
glaring up on the television screen, and he had been arrested for passing out
some kind of handbills or something, and it told about this scuffling over this
Cuban thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let me interrupt you there for a minute now. That's the first
you ever heard, or the first knowledge you had, that Lee Oswald was mixed up
in any way with this sort of activity, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, yes; I had no idea that he was mixed up in anything like
this, and I was shocked when I saw his face come on the screen passing out
these handbills in connection with this Cuban thing, so I told my husband,
"Well, they said he went to Russia to give up his American citizenship; well,
maybe he has." I said, "I am certainly not going up there now," so I didn't go,
and I don't know whether this was before that or after that, but I called up
the lady that had rented the apartment to them&mdash;I had asked her for her phone
number at the time, and I told her at the time that I would try to send her
some tenants, so she did give me the number, so I called one time to see how
the Oswalds were getting along. Evidently this must have been after that. I
don't remember. So anyway I called and <span class="locked">said&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would that have been Mrs. Garner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; that's right; Garner. I told her, I said, "This is Myrtle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Evans, who helped Lee Oswald get that apartment; how are the Oswalds
getting along," and she said, "You know, they are a queer kind of people," and
she said, "I just told him, 'After all, how do you expect your wife and your
child ever to speak the English language when all you ever talk to them is in
Russian'?" She said, "I told him, 'This girl doesn't know a word of English,
and I can't converse with her at all'," and she said, "I asked him why he didn't
talk to her in English and let her learn some English so that she can talk to
the people that live here in this country, instead of always in Russian."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say he said when she said that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, she said he didn't say anything. She said she tried to
help them in different ways, but they didn't seem to want her to help them, and
that the girl couldn't talk a word of English, so she couldn't understand her
anyway. She said that Lee had for some reason always talked to her in Russian.
She said she told him, "She will never learn to speak English if you keep talking
to her in Russian." Now, that must have been prior to the time that I saw this
deal on television, and then the next thing I knew about Lee, it was all over
television, that he had killed the President, and the rest of it you know. I
didn't even know he was back in Texas. I thought he was still living on
Magazine Street and working at the Reily Coffee Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't know he was back in Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; because I never did go back when I saw this flash about the
Cuban situation on TV and Lee's picture all over the screen. I said "If he is
Russian, I don't want to get dragged into it. Maybe they will think I had something
to do with it."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you just stayed away, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right; I didn't want to take a chance in getting involved
in anything like that. However, I will say this, I would have loved to meet
Marina. Maybe you can call it curiosity, or something, but I did want to meet
her. She seems to be such a lovely person. I couldn't tell you where they
lived in Texas. I never heard from them any more after that. I would have
liked to tell his mother how sorry I felt for the loss of her son, and things like
that, but I just don't know how to go about something like that now. I guess
it's just one of those things, but I sure do feel sorry for her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me this: In the time that you knew Lee, did he pretty much
get his own way? Would you be able to say as to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I would say he did; definitely. She would try to give him
everything he wanted&mdash;that she could, I mean, and do everything he wanted
her to do. I've seen that happen many times in the time that I knew them
and especially while they lived at my house. I mean, she couldn't give him a
lot of material things. She just didn't have much, you know, but she would
try to pacify him. That boy was so inclined to be within himself, that it was
hard to figure him out. I guess no one will be able to tell what was really
in his mind. They called him a "loner", and I guess that's about the best description
you can give him. He was certainly a quiet type boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you observe with respect to his relations with other
children? Just how did he regard them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, to be truthful with you, I never really saw him with anyone
except his mother practically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall when you had a discussion with Marguerite with
respect to her leaving Lee with a couple?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, yes. Marguerite told me that she had this couple at her
home looking after Lee. Lee wasn't 3 at that time, you see, and so he wasn't
old enough to put in a nursery, but then the neighbors began telling her that
they were cruel to her child when she wasn't home, and that the child was
doing a lot of crying, and so she came home from work early one day, and she
said her baby was screaming, and he had welts on his legs, and that this man
had beat her baby, and so she put them out that night. Now, who they were
or what their names where, I don't know, but she said that no one would take
Lee, and she just didn't know what to do with him while she was working, so
that's why she got this couple in the first place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why wouldn't anybody take Lee?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I mean, she couldn't put him in a home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Because he was too young?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Because he was too young, that's right. The older boys could
be put in a home&mdash;in fact, of course, they were, but Lee was not yet 3 years
old, and they have to be 3 before a home will take them.</p>

<p>She didn't want to go to the welfare, because once the welfare goes into a case
and gets hold of a child, you have nothing but red tape and everything, and
sometimes you have a hard job getting your child back, so she didn't want to
fool with them, and yet she couldn't put him in the home, so she said there was
nothing else for her to do but to try to get somebody to take care of him, which
she did, and she was sorry she ever did that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say Lee denied to you during your discussion with him
that he had ever tried to give up his American citizenship?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; he said that he never intended to do that, but he just wanted
to see the country, over in Russia, and see how they live and how the country
looks, and so he went into Russia and got a job there and was working, and
then he met this girl, and they got married, and he told me he would have been
back sooner if he had figured out some way to get her out of the country.
Actually he didn't seem to want to talk too much about it, and I didn't try to
pump him too much, but I was just curious to see if he had had any change of
mind, and what had really happened. I do feel that he was sympathetic with
the Communist system of government, I mean, of the Russian system, but now
I was only with him a few hours, and we just generally talked about his mother
and his brothers, and his job, and looking for an apartment, and he didn't even
tell me at the time that his wife was expecting another baby, and I was surprised
when I heard that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say about his brothers and his mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, he said the boys where in Texas, and that his mother was
fine, and that she was in Texas, and I think Robert, or one of them, had a
couple of children. I think that was Robert that had a couple of children,
and we just talked generally about things like that, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you get the impression that he was patriotic toward the
United States, or what kind of an impression did you get in talking to Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, like I said, he seemed to be sympathetic toward Russia, but
he told me that he was glad to be back in the United States, and that the only
reason he was in Russia working at all was because he had married this Russian
girl and wanted to get her out of the country, or he would have been back
sooner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything about his having served in the Marines, anything
about how he felt about that service, or did you know he was in the
Marines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I sort of half way knew about it, maybe from his aunt; I
don't know, but I don't even remember if Lee mentioned that fact in our discussion
that day. I don't really remember that. I do know that he always wanted
to go in the Marines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He always wanted to go into the Marines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me about that. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, because when he was going to Beauregard, he wanted to
be a marine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He expressed that to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; he always wanted to be a marine. He often said that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall a period of time when he wasn't in high school, but
he still lived there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. You mean in my apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; because they moved from my house, and I lost contact with
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But while they were living in your apartment, did he actually
express a desire to go into the Marines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; he was always ambitious to be a marine, as far as I know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever express a desire to be like his brother, since it wound
up that they were both in the Marines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, yes; I think he wanted to be like his brothers; they were
both in the service, you know. I think John was a marine, but I can't remember
what branch of the service Robert was in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, John was in the Coast Guard, I think.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, the Coast Guard, and so Robert must have been in the
marines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. As long as I have known Lee though, he has wanted to be in the
Marines. That's one of the things he said he always wanted to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you learn anything as to the mother's attitude in that respect,
about her boys going into the service, and particularly Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; but Margie was satisfied that her children were going into
the service, because she didn't have the money to send them to college, so they
could graduate and all that, so it was natural that they would go in the service
after they got out of high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever meet Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; you mean the lady who brought Marina to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; because I never even met his wife. I never went there at
all. He called me, like I said, and told me that his wife had come to New
Orleans, and he said he would like for me to come up and visit them and meet
her, and I said, "Lee, I am going to try to come," and I said, "You-all come to see
us," and he said, "Come just any time." He said Marina was anxious to meet
me, and to come up and visit them at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have no further questions, but I would like to ask you this
general question, Mrs. Evans:</p>

<p>Does anything occur to you that might be helpful to the Commission that I
haven't asked you about, either because I neglected to do so or because I haven't
learned about it? If you can think of anything, I will appreciate it if you will
tell me at this time, any incident or occurrence that took place during the time
that you knew the Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; I can't think of anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say his character, and I'm talking about Lee now,
would you say it was strong or weak, or what? For example, did he give way
quickly to anger, or on the contrary was he a man of self-control?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, he could get angry with his mother. That was when he was
in his teens, of course, the way he would holler at her when he wanted to eat,
or something like that, and when he would holler, she would jump up and
practically run to do whatever he wanted her to do. Of course, I don't know
anything about his manhood, because I was only in his company about 3 or 4
hours then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say he was a pleasant and inviting individual with
whom you yourself would seek to be in his presence, or be with him, or just
what sort of emotions did he display generally? That's what I'm getting at.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, he didn't laugh too much, and he wasn't a light type of
person. He was what I would call deep. He wasn't real friendly. To like
him, you would have to know him. I mean, even as a child, you didn't warm
to him, because he was very quiet and deep, and of course I didn't have too
much contact with him. Most of my contact with with his mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, Mrs. Evans, I appreciate very much your coming in and
giving me this information, and I know it will be helpful to the Commission in
its evaluation of all the evidence with regard to this matter.</p>

<p>Now, in the taking of this deposition, it is your privilege to read your deposition
over and to sign it. It is also your privilege to waive that. In other words,
you don't have to read and sign it unless you want to. You can waive that
privilege, and the reporter will go ahead and transcribe your testimony, and it
will be sent on to Washington, but if you prefer to read and sign it, the reporter
will transcribe it, and you will be notified by the United States Attorney here
when to come in and read and sign it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
As I have told you before, your testimony will not be disclosed other than by
the Commission when and if the Commission deems it necessary.</p>

<p>What is your pleasure on that now, Mrs. Evans? Do you want to read and
sign your deposition, or do you want to waive that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, I will waive it. I have just told what I know about it, and
that's all I can tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You wish to waive the reading and signing and trust to the reporter's
ability and competence in transcribing your deposition, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right; thank you again, Mrs. Evans, for appearing here voluntarily,
and giving us this information.</p>

<h2 id="t66"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_JULIAN_EVANS" id="TESTIMONY_OF_JULIAN_EVANS">TESTIMONY OF JULIAN EVANS</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Julian Evans was taken on April 7, 1964, at the Old Civil
Courts Building, Royal and Conti Streets, New Orleans, La., by Mr. Albert E.

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are Julian Evans, husband of Myrtle Evans, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you live at 1910 Prytania Street, New Orleans, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Evans, you are a native-born American, is that correct, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. New York City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long have you lived in this area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, about 54 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your business or occupation, Mr. Evans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. D.&nbsp;H. Holmes; salesman&mdash;major appliances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long have you lived on Prytania, at that address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Let's see&mdash;it's going on 15 years now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you are Mrs. Evans' second husband, is that right, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you married before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During your lifetime you came to know the Oswald family, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; the boy and his mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Marguerite and Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; and there was another brother&mdash;two other brothers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. John Pic and Robert Lee Oswald, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right. I met them for the first time when we were across
the lake, around Covington, La.&mdash;the three boys and Marguerite, and Pic&mdash;no; I
mean Ekdahl; that was before she married him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Ekdahl was over there with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know where Mr. Ekdahl was from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. From Boston. That was the first time I ever saw any of the
boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were then living over in Covington, and that was during
the summer, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know what that address was over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; I don't remember that address. I think they rented a place
over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was in 1946, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's about right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, there are two addresses given for that place, 611 West 24th
Street, Covington, La., and 311 Vermont Street, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I don't know the address. We didn't go to the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You went to a picnic, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; we went to a picnic over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Mr. Ekdahl was there with Marguerite and the children,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, he was there, and I talked to him. He was a lot older than
she was, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Ekdahl was a lot older than Marguerite?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your impression of Mr. Ekdahl at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Very well; a fine gentleman, well educated. He seemed to know
his business. He talked about rocks and ore and things like that, and I enjoyed
talking to him. That's the only time I have ever seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I forgot, Mr. Evans, but you did receive a letter from Mr. Rankin,
general counsel for the Commission, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And enclosed with that letter was Senate Joint Resolution 137,
authorizing the creation of the Commission to investigate the assassination of
the late President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Executive Order No. 11130 of Lyndon B. Johnson, appointing
that Commission and fixing its powers and duties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And a copy of the rules and regulations under which we take
testimony before the Commission and also by way of deposition, such as in your
case; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You became aware, I take it, from these documents that you
received that the Commission was empowered and directed to investigate the
circumstances surrounding the assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy;
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am Albert E. Jenner, Jr., and I represent the legal staff of
the Commission, along with Mr. Liebeler, and our purpose for being here is to
ask you questions concerning any contact you might have had with the Oswald
family, and particularly Lee Oswald, during his lifetime, and we understand
that both you and Mrs. Evans did have some contact with the Oswalds, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you appeared voluntarily here today, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you and Mrs. Evans stay over at Covington more than a
day on this occasion that you began to tell me about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You just visited over there on one occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you visit at Covington on any other occasions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this was in 1946, so Lee would have been 6 or 7 years old,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I guess; he was pretty small.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the other two boys were also with her, you say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; they were all with her over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were they in school at the time, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I think they were in school. They were on vacation, I believe,
because this was during the summer; I am pretty sure they were on vacation
over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The two boys, that is, John and Robert, they were in a school
that was different from the school that Lee was attending, if he was attending
school, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I don't know if he was attending school or not, but I don't
think they went to the same school. These other boys went to an out-of-town
school, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's what I was getting at. I was trying to have you say it
voluntarily, rather than me say it. Do you understand that they were attending
a military school over in Mississippi?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Those two boys; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The two older boys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; I'm pretty sure that that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Lee was with his mother; he stayed with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; with his mother and Mr. Ekdahl&mdash;you mean in Covington
now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; in Texas; this was just a summer vacation over in Covington,
isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What impression did you get as to the life and habits and personality
of Mr. Ekdahl and Marguerite and Lee, that is, when they were not
on vacation&mdash;when they were moving from place to place in the pursuit of
Mr. Ekdahl's line of business, from city to city?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I think Marguerite and Ekdahl got along pretty well, except
for the kid. I mean, he wanted his own way about everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You noticed that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was quite apparent to you even though this was vacation
time when you saw them over in Covington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I don't understand that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I said, was this apparent to you even when they were on this
picnic over in Covington that you told us about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; you could notice that. It seemed like all his life, Lee
wanted his way, and that's what he wanted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you are expressing that opinion from what you have heard
and read, in addition to what you saw yourself, are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you did notice that yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, yes, I did; definitely I noticed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that the first time that you had met either Marguerite or
Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; that's the first time. I may have met Marguerite before but
not Ekdahl, and not the boys either, but Marguerite was working on Canal Street
in some hosiery shop, and I might have seen her there. I know Myrtle knew
her for quite a few years, so I probably had met her before. I just don't
remember now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What kind of a person was she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. She was a very fine person, a nice looking woman&mdash;well educated,
soft spoken, a very, very nice woman; wonderful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you get the impression that Mr. Ekdahl and she, apart from
this vacation, traveled a lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Because of his work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Living in hotels?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right; they lived in hotels and also they took Lee with
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They took Lee with them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; everywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In traveling on his job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right. They were living in Texas for awhile, I believe,
and then he did some traveling in Texas, New York, and other places, but they
would always take the boy with them when they went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You and Mrs. Evans maintained somewhat of a friendship with
Marguerite, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right. Of course, my wife knew her more years than I did.
She knew her a long time before she was even married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's right; our information shows that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. She knew her when she lived down on Alvar Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was before you had any contact with the Oswald family,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Has your wife given you any of the details regarding the background
of the Oswald family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; over the years we have discussed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I wouldn't be interested right now in what your wife told
you, because we have taken her deposition, but I just want to know what
you know of the family and your impressions of them, and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you married to Mrs. Evans when the Oswalds lived at
1454 St. Mary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me about that. How did that come about? How did you
first come to know them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, she came to town, and she wanted an apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From where did she come?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, she was living here with her sister, and they couldn't get
along, or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lillian Murret, is that who you are talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; her sister; she lives downtown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lillian Murret?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she is Marguerite's sister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; I think her and the boys were living there, and they couldn't
get along, or something, so they looked for an apartment, and she asked my
wife if she knew about a place anywhere that she might rent, or if she had a place,
and so then they moved into the apartment right next to us, and there was some
disagreement about the apartment, or something, and my wife told her she
could give her the apartment, but not for the same amount of money, or something
like that&mdash;I don't know exactly how all that took place, but my wife can
tell you that, but anyway she got mad and left, and they moved down in the
French Quarter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, it's some little short street down in the French Quarter,
you know, right off of Canal. It's not such a good neighborhood, a lot of
poolrooms and places like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would that be Exchange Alley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Exchange Alley, yes; that's it. We took them on vacation one
time on a week end across the lake with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. We took them over to my sister-in-law's place, across the lake.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say across the lake, which lake is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Lake Pontchartrain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where's your sister-in-law's place across the lake?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. At Sun, La. They are in the sand and gravel business over there,
and they have a private pond to fish in, you know, and they stock it themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
and they have some nice fish in there, and so Lee and the boys were down
there fishing, but Lee didn't talk to the other kids or anything. He just seemed
to want to be alone, and he just fished by himself, and the odd part of his
behavior that we all thought was very strange was the way he would just let
the fish die on the bank after he would catch them. Now, the other small boys
would catch them and, and if there was enough for eating and everything, they
would throw the others back, but not Lee. He would pull them in and just
throw them down on the river&mdash;I mean on the bank by the pond and just let
them lay there, and when he got through he just walked off and left them
there. Something like that is hard to understand. He didn't catch them for
eating, and he didn't want to throw them back in. He just left them on the
bank and walked off after he got tired of fishing. We couldn't understand
that at all. It showed how totally inconsiderate he was of everything. It was
a good example of how he acted, and his general attitude.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How old was he at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. He was just a young fellow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About 13, 14 or 15 years old, would you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; somewhere around there. I believe he was going to Warren
Easton at the time, or he went to Easton shortly after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He first went to Beauregard Junior High School, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; and then he went to Warren Easton when he was about
14, I think. He wouldn't talk much. If you talked to him, maybe he would
answer you and maybe he wouldn't, but you had to speak to him first. That's
the last time I saw him until he came back from Texas looking for a place
to stay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When Lee was living in the apartment with his mother, what
did you notice, or observe, with relationship to his mother? I mean, did he
seem to respect her authority, or was he impervious and arrogant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. He was arrogant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Can you remember some incident that would illustrate that
for us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, his mother would be in our apartment talking to my wife,
for example, and if he came home from school or somewhere, he would holler
real loud, "Maw, how about something to eat?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He would be demanding, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; real demanding, and loud. He wanted her to come right
now, and he had absolutely no patience with her at all, it seemed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was just not raising his voice to let his mother know he
was home, or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; it was real demanding. He would know where she was when
she was talking to my wife, and when he hollered at her, she would have to
go right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever get home early from school, or was it about the
regular time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, about the regular time, I think. I don't think he ever stayed
away from school. I think he went to school all right, but, I mean, he was
arrogant, and nobody liked him. That was the thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever associate with any of the children in the neighborhood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; he didn't. He didn't associate with anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember anything about his habits? Did he stay in the
apartment, or go out, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. He stayed mostly in the apartment. Now, when he lived upstairs
in the apartment, he would go out on the front porch and read. He always had
a few books around, paper covered books.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Paperbacks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; paperbacks. He had a lot of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he go to the public library and get books?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I don't know. I can't answer that, but he did a lot of reading,
but, you know, it was mostly this cheap stuff, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say he was a voracious reader?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, he read; he read all the time. I mean, from what I noticed
by him being around the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you notice any other traits about him that you wondered
about, or that you thought unusual or strange?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. He seemed to be in deep thought a lot of times&mdash;always thinking.
He was hard to get to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was hard to get to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever feel that you ever got to know Lee Oswald, Mr.
Evans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; I can't say that I ever did. I don't think anybody did. I
don't think anybody even came close to it, because the way he was nobody could
figure him out. It was hard to get to him or to understand him. He didn't want
you to get too close to him, for one thing. He never went out of his way to
make friends, I mean, from what I knew of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He sort of shied away from friends, or people who might have
become friends, or who might have tried to be friendly with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; that's it. You would try to be nice to him, but he wouldn't
appreciate it, and he didn't mind showing you that he didn't appreciate it. My
sister-in-law's children tried to be friendly with him when we had him across the
lake to their house. They asked him to go swimming with them, and everything,
but he just wanted to be by himself. Finally, the kids got so that they just didn't
pay any attention to him. Kids are like that, you know. If he wanted to be that
way, that was all right with them. They just went ahead and enjoyed themselves,
and to heck with him. They didn't let him bother them at all with the
way he acted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As I gather it, they tried to be friendly with him, but when he
wouldn't reciprocate, then they said, in effect, "OK, we won't be friendly; see if
we care"; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when they lived at your apartment, the address was given
there as 1454 and then later it was changed to 1452; what was that all about?
Could you explain that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, there was nothing to that. They just moved from upstairs
to downstairs. We were remodeling the apartment upstairs, and so she
moved downstairs, really next door, and when she found out that she wasn't
going to be permitted by my wife to move back upstairs, that's when she got mad
and left, but, really, Lee had become very noisy and loud, and we just decided
that we would rather not have him back in that apartment for that reason&mdash;because
he was actually disturbing everybody around there with his loudness.
You could really tell when he was home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You could?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, yes; in fact, Lee couldn't talk to his mother in a soft voice
or a low voice; it was always a very loud, insolent voice, and it seemed like he
got to raising his voice all the time, and he didn't seem to care who heard him
or what he said. You knew he was home, all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did some friction arise between Mrs. Evans, the landlady, and
Mrs. Oswald about that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; it was about the apartment, and my wife told her that she
just couldn't let her move back upstairs, and she didn't like that at all, and then
she moved away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say that Lee was a very impervious fellow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; I would say that. He had what I would call a foghorn
voice, and he didn't seem to make any effort at all to control it. He would just
blare out, and it did disturb others around the house. He had a good speaking
voice, though; I will say that; very good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, after this incident in which Marguerite took over other
quarters and moved out with her son, when next did you hear about or have
any contact with either Marguerite or Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. When he came back there to look for an apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would have been last spring?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Around May.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, sir; we were eating breakfast at the time, I think, and I was
about to leave for work, because I was due at work pretty soon, but my wife
talked to him and showed him around later, she told me, and she helped him get
an apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you notice anything unusual about Lee when you first met
him that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, when I shook hands with him, his hand was so soft; it was
just like there was nothing there, no bones or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A fishy handshake, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right; just soft, like no bones in his hand; that's the way
he shook hands.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean he didn't have a firm handclasp; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right. His hand was not solid, like the average person
that you shake hands with. It was soft. I had understood that he had been
fooling around with machinery, but he didn't have the hand of a mechanic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you heard anything about him before he came to your house
that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. You mean in connection with this Cuban thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; anything about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; that came after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right; we'll get to that in a minute. When he got to your
apartment, he rang the bell, and your wife let him in; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; she answered the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She answered the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he make an inquiry about an apartment, as to whether he
could find one, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; he did, and she said to come on in, and he came in, and
they sat down and we talked a few minutes before I had to leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you and your wife recognize him then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Immediately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. He hadn't changed. He was talking a little more. I noticed that
right away, and about his physical appearance, though, it was about the same,
except that he was taller, but you could tell it was the same Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You recognized him right away; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; I recognized him. We talked for a little bit, but I had to
leave after we had had a couple of shots of coffee, because I had to get to
work. I was on my way, in fact, when he came to the door; so I didn't get to
see him for very long that morning. When I left, my wife was talking to him
about the possibilities of getting him an apartment, and at that point I had
to leave. I left then and went to the office. Later that day my wife told me
that she had found him an apartment, and she also told me that he told her
that he had found a job with the Reily Coffee Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He had found a job with the Reily Coffee Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's what my wife told me he said, and she said he seemed to
he very happy about it, because he was going to bring his wife over from Texas,
and they were going to live here in an apartment, and my wife said he wanted
to call her right away, as soon as they found the apartment, and that a friend
was going to drive her over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your wife question him in your presence about his alleged
attempt to defect to Russia, and whether or not he had renounced his American
citizenship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, yes; she did ask him about that, but he denied it. He said
he was only a tourist in Russia, or something like that. He said he just wanted
to see the country and how they lived, and that he did not intend to ever give up
his American citizenship. The next thing we knew, we were watching television,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
and his picture came on there, as big as life, and it showed him passing
out leaflets or something. I think it was on Canal Street&mdash;no; I think that
was on Bolivar. Anyway, the signs read, "Free Cuba," or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could that have been "Fair Play for Cuba"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your reaction when you saw this on the screen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, we didn't know what to think; whether he was in this
by himself, or whether he had accomplices, or what, and my wife had planned
to go up and visit his wife up at their apartment up on Magazine, but after
that came on the screen, and all, she decided not to go. She said she didn't
know what he was getting himself involved in, but that she had better not go
up there, and she didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then neither you nor your wife visited them at their apartment
on Magazine Street; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they never did visit you after that, either; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right. They didn't visit us, and we didn't visit them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion of President Kennedy at this breakfast
that you had with your wife and Lee that morning he first showed up&mdash;at
least, before you left for work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anything like that mentioned at all as long as you were
there, at least?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No. Like I said, I just finished a cup of coffee and left. I had
to get to the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see Lee Oswald in any fits of temper, so to speak?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; I didn't. I never did actually see anything like that, but I
could hear him all right, the way he would shout at his mother and so forth.
I mean, but I never did actually see him at times like that. He would be up
in the apartment. From what I could hear, though, I could tell that he was
very demanding of her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Very demanding of his mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What other impressions did you have of this boy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I thought he was a psycho. I really did. He was so young
to be acting the way he did. Of course, there is no doubt that his mother really
spoiled him. She would do just about anything he wanted, if it was possible
to be done, like giving him money or anything like that, and I understand that
he was the cause of his mother's divorce from Ekdahl. Ekdahl said that Lee
was more demanding of his mother than he was, and he was her husband.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had the impression that Lee came between her and Mr.
Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give me your impression of Marguerite Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Marguerite?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I think she's a fine woman, myself, a fine woman; intelligent,
very soft spoken&mdash;a beautiful woman, with black hair streaked with a little
gray, but when you saw her on television since this thing happened, she really
looked awful; nothing at all like she used to look. She has really aged. She
looked like a charwoman, compared to what she used to look like. She used
to be a fashion plate. She dressed beautifully, but when we saw her on television
just recently, after all this happened, she looked awful. There's no
other way to describe it, the change that has come over her. You wouldn't have
recognized her if they hadn't told you who she was; she looked that different.
Where her hair used to be black, now it's entirely gray, and she really looks
old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, she's 57, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That's right; she's the same age as my wife, but she looks about
70 now. That's about all I can remember about her, and then I saw this thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
on television when the President was assassinated, and when it showed her
picture, we just couldn't believe it was Marguerite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you home when her picture came on television, along with
this news of the President's assassination and Oswald's arrest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; I was at the store at the time. It was on television there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you do when you saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I immediately called my wife, and I said, "Do you have the television
on?" and she said, "No," and I said, "Well, put it on." I said, "They are
holding Lee Oswald as the assassin," and she said, "No; that can't be!" and I
said, "Turn on the television and see for yourself."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever observe anything about Lee Oswald that would
lead you to believe that he had any propensity toward acts of violence on the
person of anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; he was a good talker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was a good talker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; he was. He had a good vocabulary; pretty good for his
age, anyway; so I guess all that reading he did must have accounted for that.
Also, he had a pretty good memory, for one thing, and his expressions were good,
but he was very noisy and would talk in a loud voice all the time, especially
when he wanted something from his mother or wanted her to do something for
him. I used to think it was pretty awful the way he used to yell at her, but she
didn't seem to mind. She would jump up the minute he yelled, and she did
everything for him that she could. But he did have a booming voice. You
don't see a voice in a kid like that, at 13 years old, very often. His voice was
just about changing then, at that early age.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he seem aggressive in that respect, at least with other
children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; I would say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your impression of this man in general when he came
back to New Orleans in 1963 and you had occasion to see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. In what way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, say, with respect to money; what was his financial status?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. You mean this boy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, Oswald; what was his status with relation to income or
the amount of money he possessed, or anything like that? What did you learn
about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well I don't think he had any money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was your impression; that he had no money, or any outside
source of money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes. He couldn't even afford a nice apartment for his wife and
child. He had to get the cheapest apartment he could find, because we had friends
that had other places that he could have gotten, but he couldn't afford anything
better. He did not have money; that's what seemed to be so odd, to our
way of thinking, when we heard those rumors and reports that he was getting
money from other sources to do all of this stuff that he seemed to be getting
into. We just figured if he was getting any other money, then he would be
living in a better place and taking better care of his family, but he couldn't
afford to pay for anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then you saw no evidence of him having any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you think it possible that he might have received any substantial
quantities from any other source?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; I don't. Even his clothing was bad, all worn, and he didn't
have a coat on that I ever saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No coat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Just a sport shirt is all, when I saw him. I don't know of any
other income he could have had. Of course, his mother might have been
helping him. If it was possible, I know she would have helped him. I don't
think his brothers helped him any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does anything else occur to you that might be helpful to the
Commission in its investigation; anything that I might not have asked you about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
or that I just didn't know about, and that you think might be of assistance
to us in this investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; not a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, this deposition will be transcribed by the reporter, and
you have the privilege under the law of reading and signing your deposition.
However, you don't have to do that. You can waive that right and let the
reporter transcribe the deposition, and it will be forwarded direct to Washington,
to the Commission. Now, what is your preference in that regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I will waive that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You will waive that privilege?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; I can't think of anything else besides what I have already
told you. I didn't actually know Lee too well, because he just wasn't the
type of man you could get close to. He just sort of lived in his own world, I
guess you would say, and he didn't want friends, or at least that was my impression,
and I did have enough contact with him that I could arrive at my own
opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, Mr. Evans. Thank you very much for coming in voluntarily
and answering these questions.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="t75"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_PHILIP_EUGENE_VINSON" id="TESTIMONY_OF_PHILIP_EUGENE_VINSON">TESTIMONY OF PHILIP EUGENE VINSON</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Philip Eugene Vinson was taken at 2 p.m., on April 1, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you rise and I will administer the oath. Do you solemnly
swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am a member of the legal
staff of the President's Commission To Investigate the Assassination of President
Kennedy. I have been authorized to take the testimony of witnesses by
the Commission pursuant to authority granted to it by Executive Order 11130,
dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution of Congress No. 137.</p>

<p>The Commission's rules require that a witness be given 3 days' notice prior
to the time that he can be required to testify. I don't think you have been
given 3 days' notice, but you are entitled to waive that notice if you want to.</p>

<p>I assume that as long as you are here, you are perfectly willing to waive it
and go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I want to give you now a copy of the Executive order that I
just mentioned, plus the Resolution of Congress No. 137, and the rules of procedure,
which rules have been adopted to govern the taking of testimony from
witnesses. You may keep those documents and refer to them as you wish.</p>

<p>The Commission understands that you were a classmate of Lee Harvey Oswald
in the second grade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. While that may not seem to have too much relationship to
the events of last November, one of the purposes of the Commission is to try
to determine, assuming Oswald's guilt, his motive. In that area it might be
that the kind of person he was when he was in the second grade or younger
than that, throughout his youth, may have some relevance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Before we get into the details of that, however, I would like
you to state your full name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Philip Eugene Vinson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where do you live, Mr. Vinson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. 4325 Baell Street, Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are presently employed as a reporter for a Fort Worth
newspaper, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Which newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. The Fort Worth Star Telegram.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long have you been employed by them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Since July 15, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What kind of work have you been doing for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Reporter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any particular specialty, or just a general reporter;
what kind of work are you actually doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. We have a bureau in Arlington, Tex., which specializes in covering
suburban news in the community between Dallas and Fort Worth, and we
have two reporters assigned to this bureau, and I am one of the two reporters
in this bureau at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you are actually presently located or based in Arlington;
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. That's right. We have an office in Arlington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you been doing this same work ever since you went to
work for the newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What other jobs have you had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. When I started, I was given the routine work that most beginner
reporters assume. You start out writing obituaries and just general
assignments on the city side or working through the city editor, and I did
that for about 6 weeks.</p>

<p>During this time I was doing this 4 days a week, while on Saturday they
were training me to take over the police reporters job. And I worked 4 days
out of the main office and 1 day from the police station for about 6 weeks.</p>

<p>And then around the first of September I became a full-time police reporter
for the Evening Star Telegram, and I worked as a police reporter until about
October the 1&mdash;excuse me, until about, I would say, around October 20, the
latter part of October. I don't know the dates exactly, but I stayed as a
police reporter for a little less than 2 months. Then the management decided
that they were going to establish this bureau in Arlington, and I was chosen
along with another reporter to come out to work in Arlington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How old are you, Mr. Vinson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Twenty-three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. July 6, 1940.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Childress, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. It is just at the beginning of the Panhandle. It is about 120
miles west of Wichita Falls and about 150 miles southeast of Amarillo, just at
the base of the Panhandle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long did you live there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. I lived there until the summer of 1947, with one exception. We
moved to Fort Worth in 1945, 1946, for a short time, about 3 months, and my
father was working in Fort Worth, but my mother and I, there was this big
housing shortage after the war and we couldn't find a place to live, so we moved
back to Childress until my father was able to find us a place to live. That was
in the summer of 1946, as I recall now, because I started to school in the first
grade in Childress that fall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Then you and your mother finally moved to Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes; in the summer of 1947, we moved to Fort Worth, and that
fall I started to school in Fort Worth, and that would have been the second
grade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You went to the first grade in Childress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you went to the second grade in what school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Lily B. Clayton Elementary School.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you live in Fort Worth at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. 661 Seventh Avenue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any brothers or sisters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. I have one brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Older or younger?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Younger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How old is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. While you were in attendance at the Lily B. Clayton School,
did you know another student by the name of Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember when you first met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why don't you tell us everything that you can in your own
words about what you remember about Lee Oswald as you knew him in the
second grade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Well, I have no idea when I first saw him or actually became
acquainted with him. The best I remember, he was there when I got there, and it
was my understanding that he had already been there before I got there.</p>

<p>In other words, all the other kids knew him from the previous year.</p>

<p>The thing that stands out most in my mind about him is that when we would
go outside for unsupervised play, when we weren't engaged in games supervised
by the teacher, where we were just turned loose and allowed to do what we
wanted to, we would break down into little groups, and I remember the boys
called them gangs.</p>

<p>We used to say, "Are you in so-and-so's gang", and there were several key
people, all boys in the class, who seemed to, I don't know if they were organizers,
or just somehow assumed the responsibility of being the leaders.</p>

<p>But there were, I couldn't say how many, maybe three or four boys who, you
know, acted as leaders of these gangs, as we called them, and I recall fairly
vividly that Lee Oswald was one of the leaders of one of these gangs. And we
would do, one gang would start chasing the other gang. It was just a bunch
of horseplay, horsing around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many kids were involved in this altogether?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Well, the boys in our class.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The boys in your second grade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. In our second grade class, and I venture to say there may be 15
or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Fifteen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Well, now, you mean in the class?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. I imagine from the way classes generally run, they were&mdash;there
were probably about 30 students in our room, in our class, and I can't remember
whether the boys outnumbered the girls or not, but I would say maybe 15 or 16,
or maybe a little less boys.</p>

<p>And maybe these so-called gangs would just include two or three people in
addition to the leader. This has been so long ago that it is very vague, but I
do remember this.</p>

<p>And I remember that Oswald was pretty stocky and well built, and it seemed
that the other boys used to look up to his&mdash;let me start over. They seemed to
look up to him because he was so well built and husky and everything and it
seemed like all the rest of us were a bunch of little guys, but I remember we
would make reference to Lee being big and strong and this sort of thing. And
this could be because, from what I judge, he was a little bit older than most of
the boys, almost a year. The age makes a little more difference at that period
than later on.</p>

<p>And it seemed that this so-called gang that he was head of seemed to be the
top one, and all the boys would look up to anybody that was a member of his
little group.</p>

<p>And they seemed to look up to him and he was considered sort of a tough-guy
type, although not as a bully.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He wasn't a bully?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Not that I remember. I don't think he was at all because I
remember several other boys who were, and I just don't recall that he had
any tendencies like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember him getting into any fights with anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No; none other than just playful fights, just wrestling out
on the schoolground. Really not out of anger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He never had any occasion to fight with these other boys
who you have described as bullies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you a member of Oswald's gang?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No; I wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember the names of any of the fellows who were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No; I don't. Like I say, this was just a playlike sort of thing,
you know, and I don't know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember anything else about Oswald and these
out-of-school activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. I don't remember anything about him out of school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I mean out of the classroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Out of the classroom, no; I don't know. In the classroom,
I don't think he was a discipline problem at that time, because the teacher
we had was pretty much of a hot-headed lady. Or maybe I shouldn't say
that. Maybe not hot headed, but she was a teacher and she had a big paddle
and she kept that in the cloakroom, and I remember that certain boys repeatedly
got the treatment, and I don't remember Oswald ever having this happen to
him.</p>

<p>He might have been called down for talking or something. Of course just
about everybody is for one time or another, but he seemed very&mdash;my recollection
of him, he seemed fairly quiet. Just he didn't make a lot of noise. He didn't
brag or shoot off his mouth a lot. He just seemed to be a quiet type of kid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think that his position as gangleader or one of the
gangleaders was the result of just his physical size?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes; I think that had a great deal to do with it. I think he
was not tall. I was looking at our class picture, and there were several others
that were taller and actually all around bigger than he was, but he was just
sort of solidly built, just sort of stocky. And this is something that I don't
really remember. I was talking to our teacher later on who, incidentally, said
she did not remember him at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is her name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Mrs. Florine Murphy, and she still teaches the second grade
at that school, and she said she had talked to another boy in the class who
had remembered him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you what his name was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Bill Barnes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know Barnes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. I know who he is. I remember that he was in my room that
year. We moved from that area uptown, and I only went to that school 1
year, and I remember his name, and I remember who he was, and I had occasion
to see him several other times in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>He went to TCU over there, and I think he was a cheerleader or something,
and I saw him at the TCU football games, and I just had run across him
several times, but recently not to speak to him. I just saw him and remembered
that he was in my room at grade school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you discussed with him his recollection of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No; I didn't. I couldn't get hold of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you try?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes; I think I didn't try hard enough. I think I just didn't
get an answer at the house or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Mrs. Murphy tell you what conversation she had with
Barnes about Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Let me back up a minute. I believe she told me that she talked
to Barnes' mother rather than Barnes himself, and Barnes' mother repeated
something that Barnes had told her about remembering Oswald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, for whatever it is worth, what did Mrs. Murphy tell
you that Mrs. Barnes had told her, that Bill Barnes had told his mother about
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Well, this really apparently has no bearing on the thing, but
it just goes along with the whole business. Barnes said that he remembered
Oswald, and he remembered that the boy used to always ask him why he was
so big and strong and he replied in the manner of Popeye, "I eat me spinach".</p>

<p>That I do remember, although as far as Oswald speaking is concerned, I recall
that I thought his dialect was a little unusual, and he would say things like
"Give me dat," or "dis" for this, and I took somehow I took, or associated
this with New England or New York or Brooklyn or something, and I think
this sort of substantiated my opinion of him as a tough guy, because at that
time all the gangster movies, all the gangsters were always from Brooklyn
and talked with a Brooklyn or sort of dialect, and somehow I thought this made
him tough.</p>

<p>But I later found out, of course, that he had lived in New Orleans and possibly
this had something to do with it, or possibly there was a speech impediment.
I don't know, but I do remember that was what&mdash;was one thing that
I do recall about him was the way he spoke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Apparently from what you have told us, he didn't have any
particular difficulty getting along with the other boys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Not that I recall at all. Now, I don't know what he did after&mdash;outside
of school. Like I say, to my knowledge, I knew a good many of the
boys in the class, and to my knowledge, none of them ever played with him or
went to his house for anything after school. They could have, but I don't
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did that seem strange to you at all, in view of the fact that
Oswald was referred to as a leader on the school ground?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. It didn't at the time. However, it did later, it seemed strange
now. I don't recall that I thought anything at all about it at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you knew of none of the boys who ever went to Oswald's
house or associated with him outside of the classroom or outside of the playground,
at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. I knew of none, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know where Oswald lived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. I didn't, but I somehow had the notion perhaps I had seen
him walking home, but I had an idea about where he lived, about where I thought
he lived, however, I don't know. I never went to his house or I never knew
anyone who did, or anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know whether Oswald had any brothers or sisters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever see Oswald after you left the second grade at
Lily B. Clayton School and moved away to another section at Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. If I did, I don't recall. It is possible, because I do recall that
I ran across several of the kids that I had gone to school with over there after
I moved away, but I don't know whether he was one of them. I just don't
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What school did you go to? What school after you left Lily B.
Clayton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. G. E. Talldy Elementary School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you go to high school from elementary school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No. I went to that school from the third grade to the sixth
grade, and then to junior high for 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What junior High.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Meadowbrook Junior High.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that in Fort Worth, also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And from there you went to high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Polytechnic High School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Also in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you gone to college?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. I went to two colleges. I went to Arlington State College.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. For how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Well, it is broken up into a couple of segments. I went there
in the fall of 1958, and the spring of 1959. The fall of 1959 and the spring of
1960. Part of the summer of 1960. Half of the summer, one semester. I did
not go to college at all in the fall of 1960.</p>

<p>Then in the spring of 1961 I went back to Arlington State College, and in
the fall of 1961, I went to Arlington State College, and the spring of 1962
I transferred to North Texas University in Denton. I went there that semester,
both semesters, all of 1962, and the spring of 1962. The spring of 1963&mdash;excuse
me, and half of the summer of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you graduate from that school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you major in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Journalism.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you ever met anybody since you moved away from Lily B.
Clayton that knew Oswald either at Lily B. Clayton or anywhere else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. I talked on the telephone to Richard Garrett. I wrote an article
in the Star Telegram dealing with the fact that I had gone to school with Oswald
in the second grade, and I couldn't pin it down and we really went off half-cocked
without being certain when I wrote the story, when the story was published,
although I did remember the name, and I had the class picture, and we
compared it with some later class pictures, and we were all convinced it was
the same person, although I could never find the teacher that&mdash;the day I was
trying to do this and I couldn't get access to any records showing that he had
gone there in the second grade.</p>

<p>But nevertheless, I went ahead and did the article, but I was trying to contact
everyone I could who had known him, to see if they could help me, and I talked
to Richard Garrett who is mentioned in the Life Magazine story. He had
known of Oswald in the sixth grade, and he had seen Oswald again when
Oswald came to Arlington Heights High School for a short time, and he told
me just a few things.</p>

<p>I didn't talk to him long. I asked him, of course, if he recalled what elementary
schools he had gone to, and he said that he didn't, although he knew that
he had gone to some others in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He, being Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did Garrett know of Oswald in the sixth grade?</p>

<p>Was that Lily B. Clayton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No. Oswald left Lily B. Clayton, according to Don Jackson
who wrote this Life article. He did some real extensive research on it. I see
you have a copy there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are referring to the article on Oswald which appears in
the February 21, 1964, issue of Life Magazine, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes. On page 69, it quotes Garrett. It was the fifth and sixth
grades. I was trying to find which school it was. I believe it was Ridglea
West Elementary School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Garrett tell you this or you just said this on the basis
of the article?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes, he told me this, too. Well, actually, I can't remember offhand,
but I was just trying to refer to this to see if this is accurate, and I feel
sure, I believe it was Ridglea West.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would it be the George Clark Elementary School?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No. That was another year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I believe Oswald did originally go to that school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes. Ridglea West Elementary was Mrs. Clyde Livingston.
And then it mentioned his fourth grade marks revealed a downward trend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What else did you talk to Garrett about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Well, as far as the school is concerned, I don't remember offhand.
I think it was Ridglea West. Garrett told me that he had known Oswald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
in the fifth and sixth grades, or I believe that is what he says in here. I
believe he told me specifically the sixth, and then he said that he saw him
again in high school when Oswald came to high school at Arlington Heights
High School. And he said he approached him, that Oswald approached
Garrett something to the effect that, asked him if he remembered him from
grade school, and I believe Garrett said that he didn't at first, but after awhile,
he finally thought back and remembered who he was. And he told me that
Oswald mentioned something about communism to him somehow. He was
trying to sell Garrett on the idea of communism.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was while Oswald was in the Arlington High School?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. That was what Garrett said, and Garrett said he went to the
principal about this, and he said that a few days later he did not see Oswald
any more, and he didn't know if he had been withdrawn or expelled or what
the situation was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He never associated with Oswald to any particular degree at
this point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Not at this point. He said he "shied away from him after he
gave me this communism pitch."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Garrett tell you when this was? What grade in high
school he was in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. If he did, I don't recall. I think it was the sophomore year
in high school, the 10th grade. It says in this article, but if this has got to
come from my recollection, I would think it was the 10th grade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Garrett tell you anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. That is all. I just let him go because he couldn't help me
much. Somebody else was already doing the story on him and what he remembered
about him, and I was just trying to pin down what school Oswald
went to in the second grade, at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You said that you yourself wrote an article in the Fort Worth
newspaper about your own acquaintanceship with Oswald in the second grade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have a copy of that with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No; I don't. I thought about bringing one, but I don't know
if that would be needed or not, since what I am telling you is in effect what
I said in there. I don't think there is anything I haven't told you that is
in there, with the exception, I think I mentioned something in there that
it seemed to me that he didn't make very good grades.</p>

<p>Now this was just something I am not sure of, but that is just the way it
seemed. And I mentioned something else that to the best of my memory
he read fairly well when the students were called on to read aloud. I don't
recall that he had any difficulty, because I remember several who did, and he
was not among those that I recall as having trouble along those lines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Other than Garrett, had you ever met anybody or talked
to anybody who knew Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No; I hadn't. Well, excuse me, yes, I have, too, on the telephone.
I talked to Mrs. Livingston who is mentioned in this story. Some
people from Life contacted me that saw the story I had in the Star Telegram,
and asked me to help try to locate some of the people in Fort Worth for their
story, and I made a few phone calls for them, and I did talk to Mrs. Livingston.
But what I talked to her about was not about Oswald himself, but
rather we were trying to locate a class picture, and we didn't talk about his
personality or anything. It was just who had a picture that Life could borrow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you find one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes. Don Jackson, the author of the story came down, and at
that time she said she didn't know of any. However, Jackson came down
and went and talked to her and he turned up with these two down at the
bottom of the page. One which shows him on the playground, and the other
which shows Mrs. Livingston with a dog that Oswald had given her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are referring to pages 68-B and 69, of the Life Magazine
which we mentioned above?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recognize the scene in this picture on page 68-B?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No; because that was not when I was in the second grade, or
in the same school with him. I believe that was in the fourth grade. Maybe
the third.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The scene is not familiar to you and does not appear to be near
the Lily B. Clayton School?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No; it doesn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to Jackson personally in connection with this
article?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You told him essentially what you have told us and what he
has reported to you as having said on page 68-B? In the article, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes. Excuse me, could you ask me that again I am not sure
I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You told him essentially what you have told us and what he
has reported you as having said on page 68-B, in the article, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. What he reported to me as having said is taken from the story
that I wrote in the Star Telegram.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did not tell him this personally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. I did tell him in effect in my own words, but rather than use
what I told him, I don't know why, for some reason he just quoted from my
story. He didn't attribute that statement to the story. However, I <span class="locked">noticed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But it is a direct quote of what you had said in your story in the
Fort Worth Star?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. I believe the story is slightly changed toward the end of the
paragraph. Let me look at it. Where it says according to our code, I believe
the wording was, "According to the code of us 7- and 8-year olds being
in Lee's gang was a high honor." I believe that is about the only big change.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any other conversations with Jackson about
Oswald other than what we have discussed here about Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Well, about what I knew of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Well, one day he came by the office in Arlington and talked to
me for about an hour, and I told him what I have told you about what I remembered
about Oswald, and then I gave him the information that I had gathered
about some other people who possibly had pictures. And this was something
else I was getting around to. I did talk to some of the people named in this
story, in Fort Worth, in an attempt to get some pictures, and he went to&mdash;went
ahead and contacted them anyway after I had already talked to them. He
was a little more persistent than I was, and it is his story and his job, and I
was just doing it in my spare time, but I didn't get too far in locating any
pictures, and he decided to go ahead and try a little harder with some of the
people that I had already talked to. One of whom was Nick Ruggieri, who at
that time, or at the time Oswald came to high school, was B-team football coach
at Arlington Heights High School, and Oswald had come out for football. Now
this is not what Ruggieri told me. This is what Jackson told me and what I
have read in the story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to Ruggieri?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss this with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Yes. And he told me he barely remembered the kid, something
to that effect. He said he had come out for a few days and just didn't show
up after awhile. There is something in the story I think, that gives that, and
I think it quotes another coach who said he quoted Oswald as saying it was a
free country, or something, that he didn't have to run sprints, if he didn't want
to, or something to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you talked to Ruggieri, he didn't mention anything about
that, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No; he didn't. He just brushed it aside very hurriedly. He
didn't remember much about it except he had come out for the B-team and he
had disappeared after a few days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On page 72, of the article, Ruggieri is quoted as saying, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
told the boy myself that if he wanted to play, he had to finish practice with
a sprint, just like the others.</p>

<p>"He gave me the same answer. I told him to hand in his cleats."</p>

<p>The answer refers to a statement that Oswald is reported to have made to
Ruggieri that he, Oswald, would not sprint with the other boys, saying that this
was a free country and he didn't have to run if he didn't want to.</p>

<p>Did you ever discuss this subject with Ruggieri?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No; I didn't. I don't know if he was just being evasive and
didn't want to answer me, or what. But like I say, I didn't press him for any
direct information about Oswald, but I just casually asked if he knew him.</p>

<p>I believe I didn't even ask him anything specifically about Oswald.</p>

<p>I called him and told him who I was and that Life Magazine asked me to try
to locate some pictures for them of Oswald, and I asked him did he know of
any existing that I might be able to make arrangements for Life to get ahold of,
and I think he just volunteered that he didn't remember much about Oswald,
and I didn't press it.</p>

<p>But apparently Jackson talked to him and he was a little more free to speak
with Jackson than he was with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Has the FBI ever talked to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. The only time the Secret Service talked to me was last night when
he called and asked me to come over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of anything else that we haven't covered that
you think would be helpful to the Commission's work as far as your knowledge
of Oswald is concerned, or your discussions with others about Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. The only thing that I can think of offhand, this has probably
been brought to your attention, I don't know&mdash;I feel sure it has&mdash;of the allegation
by another magazine that this picture on the cover of Life is a composite
picture and is not really the actual thing, that they somehow acquired the
picture of somebody else holding the rifle and somehow got ahold of the picture
of his head and glued it on. I didn't read this. This was in Newsweek. I
didn't read it. I was told about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; that matter has already come to the attention of the
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. There was one other thing that I noticed also. Maybe I am
wrong and I should possibly go back and reread this before I make any statements
but I notice in the picture there is a scope on the rifle, and it was my
understanding that the rifle came to him without a scope, and he didn't buy a
scope until the fall of 1963, and it says in the magazine this picture was made
in the spring of 1963, apparently shortly after he bought the rifle. I think it
says he bought it in March.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you learn that the rifle did not have a scope on it
when he bought it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. I think this just was something that came out in my discussion
with some other reporters, or just in casual conversation just&mdash;somebody just
made the observation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you seen a newspaper report to the effect that a telescopic
sight was mounted on the rifle for somebody by the name of Oswald by the
Irving Sports Shop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No. The only one I know about was the place in Grand Prairie,
unless I got my facts all crossed up. I was thinking the only scope I knew about
was mounted, I thought was mounted at the range out in Grand Prairie. Is
that correct? Was there one mounted there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Not as far as anybody else knows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. Maybe I am confused. I guess I am confused about it, but I
think there was something in this article that mentioned him having the scope
mounted on his rifle at a specific time, which I thought was in the fall of '63.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There may well be something to that effect, but that doesn't
necessarily make it so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you have no direct knowledge, you haven't talked to anybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
that ever mounted a scope or claimed to have mounted a scope for Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. No. My connection with the whole thing has not amounted to
anything. I came to Dallas the day of the assassination because my newspaper
sent practically everybody over here. I was at the police station. I am not a
photographer. However, I carry a camera, and I was sent to the Dallas Police
Station to take pictures, because I was the only one in the vicinity with a camera
at that time. And I stayed there until the photographer arrived, with my
camera, and just sort of generally ran errands. I didn't do any actual reporting,
but that was when it first came to my attention.</p>

<p>Well, let me rephrase that. When I heard the name Lee Oswald, when the
reporter said that the best suspect they had in custody was Lee Oswald, immediately
it rang a bell, and almost immediately I remembered when I had
heard it, and I associated it with my second grade class, and I even mentioned
it to some of the reporters over there that day, over here that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Unless there is anything else that you can remember about
your contacts with Oswald or your conversations with others about him that you
think would be helpful, I have no other questions at this point, I would like to
thank you for coming over from Fort Worth on such short notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vinson</span>. I am happy to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Commission appreciates your cooperation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am Albert E. Jenner, Jr. I am a member of the legal staff of
the Warren Commission about which you have heard. The Warren Commission
was authorized by a Senate joint resolution of the Congress of the United States
to be created to investigate the circumstances leading to and surrounding the
assassination of our late President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Pursuant to
that legislation President Lyndon B. Johnson by Executive Order 11130, November
1963, appointed the Commission to investigate the assassination of President
Kennedy. The Chief Justice of the United States, the Honorable Earl
Warren is the Chairman of that Commission and the Commission has come to
be known as the Warren Commission.</p>

<p>The Commission is charged with sifting out the facts from fiction and to
inquire into many, many details, one of which deals with a man whose name
is Lee Harvey Oswald, during his lifetime. We understand you had some contact
with a man by that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And we want to ask you a few questions about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I will be glad to answer them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Mr. Conway, you are Hiram Conway and you are a
native Texan, are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I'm 57, will be 58 next month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will be 57 next June. You reside in Fort Worth, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your business, occupation, or profession is what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Tool inspector for General Dynamics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The General Dynamics Corp.?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Jenner and the witness Conway off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Back on the record. How long have you held that position as
tool inspector for GD?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I am sorry&mdash;will take me a moment to think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. It was in 1945, August 25, when I went to work there&mdash;in 1945&mdash;August
23, 1945, and sometime in November, I believe the 16th, is when I went
into tool inspection. That's approximate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any connection with Leslie Welding Co., at any
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. With what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With Leslie Welding Co.? [Spelling] L-e-s-l-i-e.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Tommy Bargas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I can't recall&mdash;I don't recall that name Tom Bargas&mdash;I don't
recall the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever become acquainted with or have any contact with
a man known as Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you tell us the circumstances and what occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Well, he was a child when he moved into our neighborhood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes; where I live at the present time, and he moved in two doors
from me, 7408, I believe it was two houses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Ewing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Ewing; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is a single-family frame dwelling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes, sir; two bedrooms and a single bath, kitchen and dining
room together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I'm not absolutely sure when they moved in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say "they," who is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. His mother and his older brother, who is a half brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. John Pic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes; his oldest brother, and then Robert Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, there were three boys and a mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there a husband or father?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. No; there was no man about the house. John was the oldest
one on the place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And about how old was he at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I believe he was around 8 or 9.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let's see, let's see&mdash;what year was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Oh, it must have been&mdash;I'm not quite sure, but I moved there
in 1948, and I'm not sure&mdash;I moved there in September or October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. October of 1948?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. And I'm not sure whether they moved there before the end of
the year or not, but it was just shortly after I moved there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was born October 18, 1939, so in 1948, at the time you are
talking about, he would be approximately 9 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Approximately&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had children at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I had one daughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Well, at that time, I'm almost ashamed&mdash;I don't know exactly
when my daughter was born&mdash;1933, I believe, so that would be 15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About 15 years old?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So your daughter would have had little or no contact with Lee
who was then 9 years old?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. No; very little. She was associated quite a bit with John.
She and John were approximately the same age. I believe John might have been
slightly older than her, maybe 1½ or 2 years, I'm not quite sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your daughter is now married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is her married name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Mrs. J.&nbsp;C. Bell (Spelling) B-e-l-l.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where does she live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. She lives on Santa Fe, I think, it's 2904.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall her telephone number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. CI 4-2394, it would be&mdash;Circle. I'm almost sure that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is Mrs. Conway living?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did the family live there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. How long did they live there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I think almost 4 years&mdash;it was in the vicinity of 4 years. It
might have been just a little over or a little under, but it was approximately 4
years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did these boys come to your attention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Oh, yes; John was a real nice kid and he was a friend of mine,
you know, a young friend. I taught him to play chess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes; I did, and he made an excellent player, I understand. I
think he's runner-up in the championship at Lackland Air Force Base.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I think so&mdash;John is a fine fellow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And because of your relationship especially with John Pic, you
came to know the other boys, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes, sir; fairly well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In and around the neighborhood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But having in mind Lee Oswald, at the age of 9, and by the time
he left, he was 13, you had less contact with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I had very little contact with him, just to see him in the neighborhood
was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did that contact in the neighborhood enable you to form a judgment
as to his general disposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you describe that and tell us something&mdash;some incidents
about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Well, he was quick to anger and he was, I would say, a vile
nature&mdash;he was mean when he was angry, just ornery&mdash;he was vicious almost,
you might say, is the best word I can describe it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it come to your particular attention as contrasted with his
two brothers, Robert and John?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes; John was a very genuine character, a fine boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about Robert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Robert was much more spunky than John, but Robert didn't
very often get into much trouble.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nothing like Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. No; he didn't walk up and down the street looking for children
to throw stones at, like Lee did. He was a bad kid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he get into kid fights and encounters with children in the
neighborhood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes; he would become angry with them but as far as actually
seeing him fight&mdash;the children didn't fight with him much, they got out of his
way. They would hide or move on and it would be pretty hard to catch him in
a fight because it would be pretty hard for him to have caught one of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this a persistent sort of thing over a period of 4 years or
were they isolated incidences?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Naturally, it's hard to say, but I would see those things not too
often, but you know that was just the picture it built in my mind. I didn't see
him very often&mdash;I have seen him try to fight with his half brother and his brother
and he would tear into them and they would hold him off to try to keep him out
of trouble and he would try to kick their shins, just all sort of things like that&mdash;I
don't&mdash;it's been a long time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he left alone a good deal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes, sir; quite a lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Describe that circumstance, will you please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. That would be hard for me to describe to you too accurately because
no more than I know about it, but I do know he would get home&mdash;I would
hear the boys, one of them say to the other one, "Where is Lee," and they would
say, "He's in the house," or something like that and that's about all I would
know. But I would see him in and out. He had a dog that he was very fond of,
Lee did, and I would see him play with the dog around the place and I would have
reason for accurate knowledge that there was no one there but him, but so far as
just being absolutely sure&mdash;I'm not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a recollection now whether Mrs. Oswald, his mother,
worked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes, sir; she did work and I have heard my wife speak of where
she worked, but I don't recall. She worked days and I usually worked nights&mdash;I
usually worked nights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you were around the neighborhood, was that true, of this
4-year period as a rule?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I believe it was. I'm not absolutely sure but I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At least off and on during the 4-year period you did work nights?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I'm almost sure that I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that you would get to see these boys in the daytime and after
school at least?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. It's funny, but I'm not so&mdash;not absolutely sure what year I
started working nights. I know I worked nights before I moved to Fort Worth
and I moved to Fort Worth from Grand Prairie in 1948, and that was the&mdash;was
before the Oswalds came, and I know I worked nights before they moved into
that neighborhood and I took a preference to the second shift, so I did work the
second shift at all times when it was possible since that time. It's more than
likely that I was on the second shift almost all times they were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did a time come when the family moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes; and I don't remember exactly what year it was but it must
have been in 1951 or 1952.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If they came in 1948, and they were there 4 years, that would
be 1952.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now; had either of the older boys already left before the family
moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Take this boy who you took a particular interest in&mdash;John Pic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. John went into the Coast Guard at sometime and it seems to
me that he joined the Coast Guard before they moved away, but I'm awful
cloudy on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, have you exhausted your recollection on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Well, I don't know&mdash;I remember talking to John&mdash;John, when
he is in this part of the country, he comes to my house and I remember talking
to him about it and he was quite enthusiastic about the Coast Guard, but that's
after he had been in the service sometime. I believe he left before his mother
did. He left and went into the Coast Guard before his mother moved away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You&mdash;could you refresh your recollection that he did leave before
the mother and Lee left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I believe I remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he was in the Coast Guard and stationed in New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. New York City, Staten Island, as a matter of fact?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Well, I didn't know. He married a girl in New York City and
I believe&mdash;I believe my wife told me that Mrs. Oswald told her that she was
going to New York on account of John being there. After John left, I didn't
have much contact with them at all, because John was my contact with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall whether Robert was still with the family when
Mrs. Oswald picked up and left? Or had he also entered the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. That, I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You would be very helpful to us, if you would give us the names
of some children at or about his age, who are still around this vicinity, whom
you think might recall him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. What year did you say he was born in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1939, October 18.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. <span class="locked">1939&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If he were alive, he would be approaching 25 years of age&mdash;this
would be his 24th year and he would be 25 years old next October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Well, I have discussed it with the Masseys, they live across the
street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give me their full name and address and telephone number, if
you will?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. And they don't remember it. It is H.&nbsp;R. Massey. What I was
fixing to say, I was trying to eliminate the neighborhood house by house. The
Masseys don't remember&mdash;I don't believe Barbara Anne does, Barbara Anne
would be their daughter and she is approximately his age, but I heard her say
that she didn't remember him at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is Barbara Anne living with her folks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. No, sir; she's married now. I don't know what her last name is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, maybe I could find out from her mother, Mr. and Mrs.
H.&nbsp;R. Massey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. [Spelling] M-a-s-s-e-y.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they live across the street from you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. That's right&mdash;they live at 7425 Ewing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do I have your permission to talk with Mrs. Conway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Oh, yes; I suggested that she come with me and save a trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, that would have been nice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I don't know why she wouldn't but she knows what she wants
to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I probably would like to have her come down tomorrow, if she
is free, tomorrow afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Well, my wife's brother passed away last week, and it has
been a considerable shock to her and she is on tranquilizers and her memory
isn't as good as it would be if she wasn't in such a strain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you mention it to her when you get home and I'll call out
home sometime tonight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And we will leave it up to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I'm sure she would be glad to do all she could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Can you think of any others?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. The Turners, they just live&mdash;oh, Bill Bridges would be the age
of John Pic. He was just another one of the kids in the neighborhood that I
taught to play chess at the same time, but he was older and there was no
other children in that range, and John is as old as my daughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I might talk with him on the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I don't know where he lives. He is with Halliburton, I believe,
and when he is in town he comes by to see me, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that Halliburton, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. No; that's Halliburton Oil Co. I don't know where the home
office is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you seen him around Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. The last time I saw him he came to my house and brought his
family and it's been quite a little while ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His first name is William and his last name is what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Bridges (spelling) B-r-i-d-g-e-s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, we will look in the telephone book and maybe we can
find him that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. He is with Halliburton, I remember the last time I talked to
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The older boys were attending high school and Lee was attending
elementary school, what elementary school is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I'm sorry&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. It would be Arlington Heights. These schools are changing
so rapidly and increasing so until I just don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During this period of time, did you become acquainted with
Marguerite Oswald, the mother of Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes; I knew Mrs. Oswald. She was in my house a few times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wish you would give me, if you can, your impression of Mrs.
Oswald, particularly with respect to the&mdash;to her care of these boys and Lee
Oswald during this 4-year period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Well, I think she was&mdash;my impression was that she felt burdened
with them and I think she showed a selfish attitude towards her children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Selfish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Selfish&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you elaborate on that, what do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Well, I don't have words for it except that it appeared to me
that she didn't dress them as well as she might. She didn't care&mdash;they were
embarrassed about their dress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Some of them were&mdash;John, especially and sometimes Robert, I
think, but they were very stoical, they could take it, they were good kids about
it, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did John speak to you on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. No, sir; John wouldn't ever say anything against his mother.
My daughter told me that someone said something about&mdash;hearsay, you see,
is about all I know about such things, but my daughter told me that she heard
some of the kids mention to him that his mother should buy him better clothes
or shoes or something and they didn't know why she didn't, or something like
that and he shouldn't give her as much of the money he made when he was
doing whatever work he did and he said, "She's my mother." He stood up for
her and that's all he would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it from this remark that you just made that the boys,
at least John, certainly John, did some work after school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. John sold shoes, I think, he worked in a shoe store for a time.
It seems to me at that time is when they were inaugurating this distributive
education thing and I believe that's how he got his job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did Robert work also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I don't think so. Robert would have if he could have gotten
a job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your impression of Lee on that score, was he industrious
or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes; he was&mdash;you mean Robert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; I mean Lee.</p>

<p>Was he industrious?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I don't rightly know, I have lost contact with them and he
was too small.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any impression as to whether this was an emotional
child?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes; he would become very angry and his face would flush
and he would just storm at other children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was quick to anger?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes; quite quick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did he seem to be a sensitive, an overly sensitive child?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. I suppose so&mdash;I thought he was a very strange type of person
and at the time I thought he was considerably above the average in intelligence
around that age&mdash;being 9 or 10 or 11, I mean, to catch on and to notice and be
able to learn to do little things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your middle initial, do you have one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. P. (Spelling) P-i-e-r-c-e.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You probably wondered why I asked you about Leslie Welding
Co. Do you know a man by the name of Hiram L. Conway with Leslie Welding
in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. No, I don't. I knew there was a Hiram&mdash;that&mdash;there's more
than one Hiram Conway, about three or four in Fort Worth, I understand. I
never heard of Leslie Welding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oswald worked for Leslie Welding at one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. He did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We have an FBI report on an interview with Hiram L. Conway
and that's why I started out with you on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From the time that the Oswalds left Fort Worth in 1952, from
that time on, did you ever see Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Never saw him again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or John?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Oh, yes; I see John.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He comes to visit you occasionally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. John never comes to Fort Worth without coming to see me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Robert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Robert never comes to see me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Robert lives in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Well, I don't ever see him at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He never comes back to pay you a visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Marguerite, have you seen her since they left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Since <span class="locked">when&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Since 1952?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. My wife has talked with her since then. Just briefly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Since November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. No, it was just shortly before that, it wasn't but just a few days
before that. I wouldn't think it was over 5 or 6 weeks. She ran into her in a
department store. No, I don't believe that I saw Mrs. Oswald at all, but I'm
not sure. I've seen her so many times on television and she looks just like she
always did except a little heavier and a little older, but I don't recall having
seen her, but I remember my wife did and she mentioned it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does anything occur to you that I haven't been stimulated to
ask you that you think might be of assistance to the Commission in its work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. When you were talking on the phone, I was trying to think of
anything, but I don't recall anything, even worth mentioning or even to go
with what you have.</p>

<p>When I said that Lee appeared to be a child that learned rapidly, he had
picked up chess from Bill Bridges and John&mdash;you see, I taught Bill and John
to play chess and Robert picked it up from them and then Lee picked it up from
them, and I think I remember hearing the boys say Lee would beat them once
in a while and he would become angry when he would lose a game.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You heard that, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Yes, I have heard he would become angry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Conway, you have the privilege of reading your deposition
after Miss Oliver has written it up and to sign it or to waive that privilege.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Conway</span>. Well, I don't care anything about reading it&mdash;I know what I
have said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If there is nothing else, this will conclude your deposition. I
certainly appreciate your coming in.</p>

<h2 id="t91"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_MRS_LILLIAN_MURRET" id="TESTIMONY_OF_MRS_LILLIAN_MURRET">TESTIMONY OF MRS. LILLIAN MURRET</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Mrs. Lillian Murret was taken on April 6, 1964, at the Old
Civil Courts Building, Royal and Conti Streets, New Orleans, La., by Mr. Albert
E. Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mrs. Lillian Murret, 757 French Street, New Orleans, La., after first being
sworn by Mr. Albert E. Jenner, testified as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Murret, you received, did you not, a letter from Mr. Rankin,
general counsel of the President's Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Asking you voluntarily to appear here for the taking of your
deposition.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And there was enclosed with that letter, was there not, three
documents.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. One was Senate Joint Resolution No. 137, which is the legislation
authorizing the creation of the Presidential Commission to investigate the
assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, our President; another was the
Executive order of President Johnson appointing the Commission and empowering
it to proceed, the Executive Order being No. 11130, and a copy of the rules
and regulations for the taking of testimony, adopted by the Commission itself.
Did you receive those?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, if you can remember, Mrs. Murret&mdash;and don't feel offended
by this&mdash;but ordinarily witnesses do nod or shake their heads and that doesn't
get into the record, so if you will answer right out, then it will be in the record.
Do you understand that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Experienced court reporters like this gentleman do catch head
nodding and head wagging, but technically they are not supposed to interpret
the intent of the witness. Do you understand that, Mrs. Murret?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. I assume that you gathered from these documents
that the Commission was created and appointed to investigate all of the facts
and circumstances surrounding the tragic event of November 22, 1963, did you
not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Liebeler and myself, we are attorneys on the legal staff of
the Commission. It is our task to investigate the life of Lee Harvey Oswald
from the time of his birth until his demise on the 24th of November, which was
on a Sunday, 1963, which gives our Commission a pretty broad area of investigation,
so to speak, and one of our purposes in particular is to take the depositions
of people such as you who in any way touched the life of Lee Harvey Oswald or
those with whom he was acquainted perhaps, either directly or collaterally.
We understand from the FBI reports and otherwise, from FBI interviews with
you, that you will be able to help us.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I will if I can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, just sit back and relax. There's nothing going
to happen to you. We just want to ask you what you know about Oswald, his
mother, and others with whom he came in contact, to your knowledge.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Do you just want me to tell you what I know about his life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; as far as you know. I will just ask you questions, and I
believe it will help us if you just answer them to the best of your knowledge.
I wonder if we might get the lady a glass of water.</p>

<p>(Glass of water given to witness.)</p>

<p>Mrs. Murret, let me orient you for a moment. You are the sister of Lee
Harvey Oswald's mother, are you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. First, what was your maiden name, Mrs. Murret?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Claverie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How do you spell that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. C-L-A-V-E-R-I-E.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your first name is Lillian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you born in New Orleans yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. New Orleans; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have always lived in New Orleans; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were your brothers and sisters born here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. They were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that you all are native-born Americans; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; native to Louisiana&mdash;Cajuns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Cajun and American?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then all of the family are native-born Americans; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, not my grandparents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not your grandparents?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No. On my father's side were from France, and my grandparents
on my mother's side were from Germany.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mrs. Murret, once in a while I may have to ask you a question
which is a little personal, but please accept my word that it is in good faith
and that it is pertinent to this investigation, and my first personal question is,
would you tell us what your age is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. What my age is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How old are you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I will be 64 in May, May 17.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how old is Marguerite?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think she should be 57.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Marguerite, I should say, is the sister of Mrs. Murret.</p>

<p>Now, I would like to have you tell me something about her, how many times
she was married, to whom, in chronological order.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I will tell you all I know about her. I have known her
all her life, you know. She was first married to Edward John Pic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Edward John Pic?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that P-I-C?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think we have that as John Edward Pic. Is there an explanation
for that, do you think?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I think they just reversed the name around because the
child is John Edward, but I think the father's name was Edward John, because
I think they always called him Eddie. Now, I don't know which way it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Do you happen to recall when that marriage took
place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I wouldn't remember what year, you know, or anything
like that, when the marriage took place. I know about how long they were
married. I think they were married about 2 years, but I'm not really too accurate
as to years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, as closely as you can come to it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I know what happened, but the dates I just don't recall exactly,
because I had my own affairs to take care of, so I can't remember dates in her
life, but anyway, she was married to Eddie for 2 years, we'll <span class="locked">say&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let me interrupt you for a minute. Tell me something about
that marriage. Who was he? Did the marriage, take place here? Were you
present? What do you know about that marriage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know too much about the marriage. I don't think it
took place here. I just don't know anything about that. It might have taken
place over on the Gulf Coast. I don't know if I am right on that or not. That
has been so long ago, but Marguerite did know Eddie a very long time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She had known him for some time before she married him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you known him for some time before she married him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was his business or occupation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, Eddie worked for Smith. I think they are stevedores.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he do as a stevedore?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I don't know what type of work he did. I think it was
clerical work. I think he is still with the same people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is alive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes. I think it's T.&nbsp;B. Smith, or something like that. I
don't know what the initials stand for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. T. as in Thomas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And B. as in Benny?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Smith?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Smith, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you think Edward John Pic is still employed by them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; he is&mdash;some kind of clerical work, as far as I know. The
reason I know he is is because Mr. Murret, who works on the river, saw him
out there, but it was from a distance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your husband works on the riverfront, does he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you married to your husband before or after Marguerite
married Edward John Pic?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I was already married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were already married then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your husband does have an acquaintance with Edward
John Pic, does he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, no. He just maybe occasionally will see him from a distance,
but he has never spoken with him. In fact, I don't think I would know
Eddie Pic if I saw him on the street. That has been so long ago. I don't think
I would recognize him myself. Eddie Pic was a very peculiar type of boy,
you might say a person who did not talk unless you spoke to him, and they would
come over to my home for dinner or something, and he would sit there all day
long and he wouldn't say anything. Now, I don't know whether all of this is
important. I don't guess some of it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Don't you worry about whether you think it is important or not,
Mrs. Murret. We will decide that once we get all this information assembled.
You just tell me what you know about all of this, anything that comes to your
mind that you think might be important to the Commission in this investigation.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, at the beginning when she married Eddie, she said he
wasn't fair. He told Marguerite that he was making more money than he
was over there, and she had to go back to work. She worked for Mr. Sere. He
was one of the lawyers in a law firm at that time, and Marguerite worked for
him. It was the firm of Goldberg, Kammer and somebody else&mdash;lawyers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Sere a lawyer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; they were all lawyers. They were three lawyers together.
He was secretary there at first, but then he became a lawyer too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How do you spell his name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Mr. Sere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. S-E-R-E.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is Mr. Sere still alive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is dead?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Just go ahead now with what you know about Marguerite's
first marriage.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, the way I understood it, and this is only what she told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
me now, I know nothing, you know, other than that&mdash;but she said Eddie had
lied to her about how much money he was making at this place, and that it was
a very small salary that he made. He went out and rented a house in the City
Park section, which was very high rent, and then it seems like he signed a lease
and all that, and then after that Eddie must have told her in the meantime
what he was making over at that place, and they couldn't possibly have stayed
there and paid that rent on his salary, so she had to ask for her job back again,
so they took her back again and then they paid for furniture that they got and
so forth while she was working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How old was she then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, let's see&mdash;John must be about 31 years old now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean her son John?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. They were married, I think, about maybe 4 years before
John was born. I don't know the dates or the times or anything, but you can
figure that she is 57 now, and John is 31.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, she would have been 26 when he was born, would that be
about right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Twenty-six&mdash;I don't think she was that old; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, 31 from 57 is 26.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. Well, she could have been, but I didn't think she was that
old. I thought maybe she might have been around 23 years old. Let's see&mdash;well,
John wasn't born until 4 years after she was married, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh&mdash;well, that would be 26 less 4, so that would be 22 years.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I think she was 22 about then, 22 or 23, somewhere in
there. I didn't think she was 26 yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So we can say that she was married when she was about 22 years
old; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I think that's about right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was her formal education?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She had a high school education.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Here in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; McDonogh High School. She lived with Mr. Pic, say about
2 years, and then they moved into another location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They first were in this apartment in the City Park area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, that was during the time that she left Mr. Pic, previous
to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let's start back. You said something about his having lied to
her as to his income, did you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then I believe you said he rented an apartment in the City
Park area; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she found when they went out there, or whatever occurred,
that he was not able to pay the rent on the salary he was making; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And so she went back to work.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, she remained married to him and lived with him, didn't she?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. They lived in the City Park area how long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know how long they lived there. I really don't, but I
was thinking of another time when she lived in the City Park area. That was
when I was referring to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We can come to that later. Let's just keep this in sequence, if
you don't mind, and we'll cover all of it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; so then, they rented a house in another section. I
have forgotten which section that was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Here in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes; and it was during that time when she became pregnant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that when they had the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; while they were in this regular home, you know, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
rented. It was in the lower section. I forget what section it was, probably
somewhere up in the Carrollton section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Carrollton?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; so then during that time she became pregnant, and I
remember she came over to my house and she told me that she was pregnant,
and asked what she was to do, that Eddie refused to support her. She said that
he refused to give her any money because of the fact that she was pregnant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He didn't want any children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He didn't want any children, that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This would have been when they were married approximately 3
years; would that be about right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. About 3 years married, yes, sir; about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you and Marguerite generally, fairly close?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. We were very close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Very close?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. When my mother died, she left six children, and we were
all young. My brother was the eldest, and I came next, and Marguerite was
about 3 or 4 years old at that time, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Maybe at this point we should get the names of all your brothers
and sisters. Your father died when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. My father?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, he died about 33 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thirty-three years ago?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. About that; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be approximately 1932; is that about right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Leaving your mother and you children, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when did your mother die?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. My mother died about 1911.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, she preceded your father?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So when your father died, you children were then orphans; is
that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At that time, when your father died, you were around 34 years
of age?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I was married when my father died. I had three children
when my father died. One child was a baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, could I have the names of just your family, that is yourself,
your sisters, and your brothers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I have two brothers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Two brothers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. And we were four sisters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, now give me the brothers' names.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Their names are Charles and John.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Charles Claverie and John Claverie?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are they alive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; they died while at a very young age. They died 5 months
apart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were they teenagers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No. One boy was around possibly 23 years old, and the other
one was about around 18 years old. The elder one contracted tuberculosis.
That was during World War I. He was in the Navy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that Charles or John?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Charles, and then John died; he also had TB.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he died at age 18?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Around that; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had four sisters, you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Including myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; including yourself.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. One sister was Marguerite.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And yourself, Lillian.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Aminthe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that A-M-I-N-T-H-E?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that pronounced Aminthe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; Aminthe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That sounds French, is it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; it's French.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, what's the other sister's name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Pearl. She died.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Pearl is dead?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where is Aminthe living at the present time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Aminthe is living in Knoxville.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Knoxville, Tenn.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Tennessee, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it Charles was the oldest?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; and I was next.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were next?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; John was next.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. John was next?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; and then Pearl and then Marguerite, and then Aminthe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, let me get those down by number. Number one was
Charles, number two, that would be you, Lillian.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. John was third.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. John was third, that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Marguerite was fourth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Fourth, and Aminthe was fifth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How about Pearl?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, let's see&mdash;that's wrong. Aminthe was sixth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Pearl was fifth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; Pearl was fifth. No; that's still wrong. Aminthe was
sixth. Marguerite was fifth, and Pearl was fourth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, I've got it. I will recite it now just so that we
will have it straight in the record. There was Charles, Lillian, then John, then
Pearl, then Marguerite, and then Aminthe; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How old was Pearl when she died?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She died recently. She was about 54.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was in her fifties?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she die of natural causes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I mean, she didn't have tuberculosis, or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the occupation of your father?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. My father was a motorman for New Orleans Public Service.
He worked for them approximately around 40 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say motorman, do you mean streetcar motorman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. They had those handbrakes at that time, and he taken out
the first mule car, I think&mdash;when they had mule cars, before they had the
handbrakes on the cars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, did any of you children have a formal education,
beyond high school?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you all attend and finish high school, other than John who
died when he was 18?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, did John finish high school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Charles?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No. Charles went in the Navy during the wartime. He made
about, oh, I don't know how many trips through Germany, and he was on this
transport when the United States seized the "Frederick Digross," and he wrote
a beautiful history of his trip, and I loaned it out to someone, and I never did
get it back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How unfortunate.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I never did get it back. It was really everything that
happened on the trip coming and going from New York to Germany, you know,
back and forth. He was a gunner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the transport, or a battleship or destroyer or cruiser?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. On the transport.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was a gunner on a transport?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Transport; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Marguerite is alive and you are alive and Aminthe is alive;
is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right. Aminthe is alive too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you complete high school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I did not. I didn't even go to high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you complete elementary school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about Pearl?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't think she went to high school. If she did, it was probably
just a year or so. She was married at an early age.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think you said that Marguerite did complete high school, or
did she?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I can't remember if she completed high school or not, but she
may have. I really don't remember that. If she said she did, then she did.
I can't remember because, you see, we were six children, and my mother died,
and my father's sisters lived here and we had some cousins who used to come
over and help us, you know, and of course, I being the eldest, I was pretty busy
with everything in those days. We were just trying to keep the family together
more or less.</p>

<p>You see, my father wouldn't give any of the children up, and so forth, and
so they used to come over and help us out and cook, and when I got old enough
I took over, and when the others got old enough they would help out, and that
went on and on. We did pretty well. We were a happy family. We were
singing all the time, and I often say that we were much happier than the children
are today, even though we were very poor. My father was a very good man.
He didn't drink, and he was all for his family. He didn't make much salary,
but we got along all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The reason I am inquiring into these things is that all of this
will assist the Commission in getting the background of the family and relatives
of Lee Harvey Oswald. The reason I am saying that is I don't want you to
think I am just being curious.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am trying to find out the family background so that we can
ascertain to what extent all of you were involved with Lee Harvey Oswald.
You understand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. It's nothing I'm ashamed of. I'm glad I had the life I
did, because I have something to look back to, because we were very happy.
We didn't have anything and we just did the best we could, but we were all
together and we worked together, and we made out all right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I understand. Now, was Marguerite happy, or would you say
she was resentful to any extent about anything, or what was her attitude and
demeanor, as you recall it? Just tell me about her personality.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't think she was resentful in any way. She was a
very pretty child, a very beautiful girl, and she doesn't look today at all like
she used to, you know. You wouldn't recognize her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think she's nice looking.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, not like she was years ago. She was a very pretty girl,
and I don't think that she was resentful of anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There seems to be some inability on her part to get along with
people. That's really what I am driving at. What do you know about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I found that I didn't get along with her myself all the
time, because our ideas were different on things, and of course she was a person
who if you disagreed with her or if you expressed an opinion that she didn't
agree with, then she would insist that you were wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How do you and Marguerite get along now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, we get along very well, if one or the other don't say
nothing. You see, I am forgiving, but she is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me more about that. Tell me about when you were girls,
and how you got along then.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, when we were girls, we got along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, did you have to give in in order to get along with her,
anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I guess I was too busy taking care of five children to think
about anything like that. I mean, I didn't realize anything like that. We did
get along pretty well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, let's get to the period after your girlhood, when you had
your own families. Let's start with during the time of her marriage to Edward
John Pic. Did your relations remain fully cordial, or did you begin to find
that there were times when you would have to yield, whether or not you were
careful about what you said so as not to excite her or get in an argument with
her, or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I don't think I had to be careful with what I said.
Maybe if I thought she wasn't right, I would tell her she wasn't right. I never
did feel I had to be afraid to tell her anything, you know, just to keep peace or
something like that. If I thought she was wrong, I would just tell her why
she was wrong, why I thought she was wrong, because there were things where
we just didn't think alike.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; we didn't think alike, and of course she thought I was
wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She thought you were wrong?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; she did, so then I would, you know, forget about it, in
other words, but it didn't seem like she could forget about anything. She would
just, you know, fly off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You would forgive her, but she wouldn't, was that it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This propensity on her part not to forget, was that a source of
irritation, and did that evidence itself in your avoiding controversy, and others
in your family avoiding controversy, with her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, coming to later years, was there any change?
Did you avoid any difference of opinion with her, or anything that you can
recall of that nature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, in later years, whatever dissensions we had or whatever
it was that we would have a controversy over, she would just go off, and she
wouldn't write or anything, and we wouldn't hear from her, and so forth, you
know, until something turned up where she probably needed assistance or a
place to stay, or she was coming to New Orleans and for us to put her up and
everything. I never did hold anything in, you know what I mean, things
like that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The remainder of your family, your other brothers and sisters,
I think they remained in and about the New Orleans area; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, they did for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, they all remained in and about New Orleans except for
your sister Aminthe; isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; she moved. She married and moved to Knoxville.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But the rest of your family stayed here in the New Orleans area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, my brother stayed. They were very young, and of course
long before I was married, they died, so there wasn't really anyone left, you
know, except Marguerite and I. She lived with me when I first got married,
she stayed with me then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Marguerite lived with you during your marriage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; my father and my husband and myself, we all stayed
together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You and your husband and your father and your sister Marguerite
stayed together?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; we lived on Esplanade and Roman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the business or occupation of your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. What is his occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He's a clerk for, well, he works for different companies, but
mostly for Mr. Jackson. He works at different wharves, in other words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Different what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. At different wharves on the riverfront. You see, he doesn't
belong to a union so, therefore, he doesn't stay at one wharf. He transfers to
where they have work, and sometimes if one don't have work, he will work for
someone else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me what else you know about John Pic.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. What else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, about Edward John Pic.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, about all I know about him is what she told me. She
said John wasn't supporting her because, she told me, that she was pregnant
and he refused to give her any money. It was a payday, I think, when she
told me that, and I spoke to John, but John didn't give me any satisfaction
whatever. He didn't say a thing, why or anything, what was the reason or
anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you discuss with him his refusal to support Marguerite?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; she left John.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she leave him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes. You see, she was that way, very quick. She would
do things on the spur of the minute, where maybe somebody else would think
it over before acting. I always think over things to give it a chance to cool off
before I do something, but not Marguerite. When she left him she didn't get a
divorce. She just separated. He got half of the furniture, and she got half of
the furniture, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before they were divorced?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Before they were divorced; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now if I may return a minute, you said she was very quick.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you elaborate on that a little?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; if I can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am trying to find out as much as I can about her personality.
Now, when you said she was quick, do I get an inference from that that she was
hasty, or that she was impulsive, or that she would act without thinking things
over?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; she would do that. She was quick in making up her
mind about anything that happened. She made her decisions very fast without
sleeping on them, not like me. I always try to sleep over a problem if I
have to make a decision, because a lot of times I will have a different outlook
on the thing the next day, but not Marguerite. She would just act right now
regardless of the consequences once she made up her mind. That's what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
mean. In other words, when she would find something that she just didn't
like, that was it. She made quick decisions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this a personality trait that she had as a young girl as well
as a mature lady?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't remember anything like that before she was married,
I mean, as we lived as sisters in the same home; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was after she left the home then, would you say, that she began
to develop that trait, or that you began to detect this quick acting in her
personality?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I would say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you think she failed to think things over, that she didn't
sleep on them, which was an illustration you gave a few minutes ago, but
that she acted quickly when something happened or when she needed to reach a
decision, is that it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She failed to sleep on something before she acted; is that
right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; she was too quick. I would have thought things over
before I did them, but she wouldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, she was impulsive? Would you call it that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. You can call it that if you like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I am just trying to shape this up into what you really
knew about Marguerite and about her personality behavior. I don't mean to
put words in your mouth now, and any time that I show a tendency to do that,
it is inadvertent, and if that does happen I want you to say that that isn't quite
the way you meant it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want you to put it in your own words. Do you understand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you elaborate now a little more on this personality
characteristic that we have discussed? I am interested in that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, she went to live in Carrollton, which is in the City Park
section, in Carrollton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you spell that for me, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. C-a-r-r-o-l-l-t-o-n.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Carrollton?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You will have to forgive my midwest accent, which differs from
yours.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; my southern drawl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I wouldn't call it a southern drawl. You have a distinct
Louisiana accent. It's different. The Louisiana accent is not a lazy sort of
thing. It has a reasonable sharpness of enunciation which you don't find,
say, in Mississippi and some parts of Louisiana. I just came from Dallas, and
they pronounce words with a drawl that's as long as your arm.</p>

<p>I happen to be a midwesterner myself, so my accent is hard, I mean, with a
sharp enunciation.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, during that time she was suing Eddie for a divorce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, was she working at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; she was not working then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How was she being supported?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Eddie was supporting her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Even though they were separated, he was supporting her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I don't know now if he was supporting her by that time
or not, but I know during the course of the divorce he had to pay Marguerite
alimony, and he contributed a very fair amount, and he contributed a very
good amount to John Edward, which he received until he was 18 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, that was pursuant to a decree of the court, I suppose.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; of course, during that time, when John was about 2
years old, she married Mr. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will get to that in a minute.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have the feeling that this experience with Edward Pic
embittered her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I really couldn't say. I don't think so, though. She seemed
to be pretty happy with Mr. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before we get to Oswald now, did she complain or did she show
any reaction from the divorce or anything, or was she getting along all right
on what he was giving her and what he was giving John?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, she was getting along on what she was getting from him
for herself and John, I think, and she would come over to our home. We lived
on Dumaine Street at that time, but very near there, and I would give her all
the help I could, and they would come over to dinner and things, but then I
remember one time when John was sick, when he was a baby, he had this ear
infection and she sent for Eddie. She said she was getting tired of staying up
all night long, and for him to come over and stay a while, and he did.</p>

<p>Well, I think they had it out at that time. I don't know about that, but
anyway, I think that was about the only time that Eddie saw John, was during
the time that he had this ear trouble, when he was an infant. She wouldn't let
John see Eddie. For myself, I thought that was cruel, because I don't believe
in that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now I am interested in that, Mrs. Murret. You say she refused
to permit her former husband to see the child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, now I don't know whether he even asked to see the child
or not. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you did say without prompting from me that she wouldn't
permit him to see the child, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right, she wouldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I draw the inference from that to mean that he might have
desired to see the child, but she wouldn't permit him, but you don't know
that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't know if he asked to see the child or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do have a recollection that she would not let Eddie see
the child; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right. John never saw him after that, I don't think,
not after he was a child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you said she was opposed to him seeing the child; is that
right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes; I imagine she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did anything else occur in this marriage up to the time of
Marguerite's marriage to Oswald, anything else that you would say was unusual
insofar as personality is concerned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; not that I can think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have mentioned a couple of aspects already.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't know of anything else. That would be about all
I know. When she became pregnant and they separated, you know, it was
just probably a day after that, whatever it was, but then she sued for a divorce
and went to live in Carrollton, and the divorce was granted, and she got the
child, and he supported John for 18 years. He sent him a good amount. He
never failed to make one payment, and of course she got alimony for herself.</p>

<p>Of course, living the way we did as children, we knew how to economize and
live on a small amount of money, where people who have always had a lot
wouldn't know how to do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of course I gather from what you have said&mdash;as a matter of
fact, you said it, but had you said otherwise I would have been surprised, that
your father was rearing six children, and he was a motorman on the streetcar
lines here; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were necessarily poor people.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; he made $90 a month. We paid $12 a month house rent, or
$14 a month house rent&mdash;I forget which&mdash;and every day he would give us
each $1 to do the marketing with, and we would have something left out of the
$1, believe it or not.</p>

<p>My sister Pearl, when she would have anything left, she would go to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
store and buy some material and sit down and make herself a dress by hand,
with what she had left from the $1, because whatever was left out of the $1
he gave us, if we had anything left, it didn't matter. We could buy anything
for ourselves and so forth, that we wanted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean he gave $1 to each of you each day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. $1 to feed the family; yes sir. We ate beans and rice and
spinach and vegetables and bananas and things like that, but we didn't have
big household expenses, you see. We didn't have a gas stove. We had a furnace
and things like that. There were no electric lights. In the very beginning
there weren't, and all of those expenses, you see, were out.</p>

<p>I have no bitterness toward my life as a child. In fact, I like to talk about
it, because we were always so happy. We went skating. We had skates, and
when we were teenagers, we would go skating around Jackson Square and the
French Quarter, and so forth, and my aunt would let us take up her rug any
time we wanted to dance, and she had a piano and we would go over there and
dance and play the piano, and I might say that Marguerite was able to do different
things. She was very entertaining. She could sing very well, not you
know, to be a professional singer, but she had a good voice, and then when we
had a piano that my father bought for $5 she learned to play by ear on the
piano, so we really had a lot of fun.</p>

<p>We cooked our beans and ate our beans, and drank our coffee and ate our
bread, and the rest of the time we didn't have to do all that children have
to do today.</p>

<p>I find children today are under a great strain. Their parents want their children
to grow up long before their years. They don't let them just take things
in stride any more like they used to. Now, they go to the Blue Room and
places like that, and they apparently think that's the thing to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What's the Blue Room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's in the Roosevelt Hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it a place of entertainment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; entertainment, and of course they have to go bowling
and they have to be baton twirlers, and they have to go to dances and all kinds
of school events, and it's constantly going and coming all the time, and they
just don't ever seem to relax like they used to.</p>

<p>They have children in my block who never stop. They have poor people
around there, but they never seem to relax. They don't know how to relax
apparently. My own children, well, I'm glad they didn't live like that either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right now, when John Edward Pic was approximately 2
years old, your sister, Marguerite, married Mr. Oswald; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right. Now, there's something else that happened
during that time. She told me this, and I don't know whether it's true or
not, but I guess it's true because I have never found my sister to lie about
anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You never have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever found her to have hallucinations, that things
didn't actually occur that she thought had occurred, or that she had a tendency
to exaggerate or overstate something?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I would say, when you put it that way&mdash;I would say if she
expected a person to do what she was thinking and a person didn't do that,
well, then that was the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When that happened, did she get excited about it or angry,
or show any emotional trait at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't think so. Now, maybe she may have appeared
excited. I don't know if she was excited or not. I just always felt that she
was really too quick. She would fly off too quick, and if you didn't think the
way she did about anything and you tried to explain to her, you would just be
wrong. You just couldn't get along with her if something would come up like
that. Of course, it could be you who was at fault, so I'm not saying that she
was at fault every time or anything like that. Maybe she was right, but you
just couldn't reason with her if she thought she was right, and I don't think
anybody can be right all the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me some more about that. You said she was unable to get
along with people. Now, I would like to know more about that, just as you
recall it, any incident that might have happened or anything that you noticed
about Marguerite in connection with any incidents like that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I mean, if people don't do things right, maybe it's because
they have been doing some wrong things which they had no control over or
something, you see what I mean, but at other times things might occur where
they weren't wrong, and if she didn't see eye to eye with you, then you couldn't
reason with her about it. You couldn't explain things to her, I mean. If she
thought differently, then you were just wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she was sufficiently vociferous about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She was very independent, in other words. She was very
independent. She didn't think she needed anyone at any time, I don't think,
because no matter how much anyone would try to help her or how much they
would try to do for her, she never thought that anyone was actually helping
her. So often I have helped her out, quite a lot of times, but sooner or later it
seemed like she would just take one little word or something that she would
think was wrong, and we would have these little differences.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean she would fly off the handle, so to speak?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; she would fly off, and go and that was it, and when she
would do that you wouldn't hear from her or anything, and all you could do
was just let things ride until she would come to New Orleans again, or something
like that, and then usually she would call or if accidentally I would meet
her on the street or something, and I would go ahead and give her help again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It would occur that when she would fly off the handle sometimes
you wouldn't see her for a while?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that about the pattern of what happened when these incidents
would arise?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you make efforts to get along with her, since you were the
older sister and really head of the family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you try to mollify her and tell her that she shouldn't act
that way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, that was all in later years. That was after her marriage
and after my marriage, naturally. She might not like something my children
were doing and so forth, and I told her that I always believed my children,
whatever they told me. She asked me if I did that, and I said yes; I did, and
that I had reason to believe them. I had faith in them, and I felt they would
always do the right thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She questioned that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. With me, yes; I mean, about the children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She questioned you to the extent that she thought it was unwise,
or she didn't get it that you should have faith in your children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right. She told me at one time, and I can remember
this incident that happened if you want me to tell it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Go ahead and tell me about it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. The incident was just recently, I may say. My son John was
just married October 5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of what year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. This year, 1963&mdash;this past year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your son John?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; well, she was over at the <span class="locked">house&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who are you talking about now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Marguerite</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, Marguerite was over at the house, and what happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Before he married this girl that he did marry, there was a
young lady that he would invite over to our home quite often, you see, so Marguerite
was over at the house at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are talking about your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; my house; and she was just visiting alone, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
a rainy day, and John and this girl friend&mdash;we were all in the front room, so
to pass the time, they were passing notes to one another, and so the next day
she told me about that, and she said that they were passing notes about her,
so I questioned John about it, and he laughed. He has a very good disposition,
and he laughed and he said, "Well, of all things," and he said, "We were passing
notes telling each other what our bad traits are." He said, "She would pass
me a note telling me about a bad trait I had, and then I would pass a note back
to her and tell her a bad trait that she had." They were getting a big bang
out of that, but Marguerite was under the impression that they were talking
about her, and so I told her, I said, "Well, I believe John," and she said, "Do
you believe everything they tell you?" and I said, "Yes; I believe what they tell
me." Now, this was just last fall that was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that just this last fall, in October?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No. Now, John was married in October, but I hadn't seen&mdash;this
was quite a while previous to that&mdash;maybe 2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, this incident occurred then back in 1961, would you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. About the time Lee defected to Russia. Probably about that
time, or after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it after 1959? That's when Oswald defected.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Let's see. I can't remember when that was now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was mustered out in September of 1959, and he went to
Russia right after that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I just can't remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you tell me about the Oswald marriage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I knew Lee Oswald. He was an insurance collector on my
route.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lee Oswald was an insurance collector?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. For Metropolitan; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He collected insurance premiums?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. For the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that weekly or monthly, or what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Weekly or monthly or yearly, sometimes semiannually, and so
forth. He collected policy payments for them. He was a very good insurance
man, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was an energetic man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you first knew him, he was married; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; he was already divorced from his wife when he collected in
my area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was already divorced from his wife?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had he had any children of that marriage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't think he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your recollection as to how Lee Oswald and Marguerite
became acquainted?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I guess he just liked Marguerite enough to marry her, and
I believe Oswald was a Catholic&mdash;I'm not too sure of that&mdash;and Marguerite was
a Lutheran, so he had to leave his church, naturally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He had to leave the church?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Because he was divorced; yes. He was not recognized in the
Catholic church. He couldn't receive the sacraments, in other words. He
could go to mass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He happened to be Catholic?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you Catholic?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. So am I, and I just wondered if you were. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. So they were married in a Lutheran Church, Lee Oswald and
Marguerite. They were married at the Lutheran Church on Canal Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was going to ask you what your family was by way of religion.
You are Catholic.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you always been Catholic?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, not always. I wasn't always a Catholic. My father was
Catholic, and my mother was a Lutheran, and we were baptized in the Lutheran
religion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were baptized in the Lutheran religion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; and my father, who was Catholic, he always saw that we
went to Sunday school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He would see to it that you went to the Lutheran Sunday school,
to the Lutheran church?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; he did. I always thought of my father as St. Joseph. I
don't know why, but I guess it was because he was so close to us children. He
would take us on Christmas eve night over to church, and he probably did a lot
better than a lot of women do today with a family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, he was undoubtedly quite a tolerant man then.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your mother had begun to rear her children as Lutherans, so he
continued that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He didn't attempt to induce any of you to become converted?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No. John Pic&mdash;rather, Eddie Pic was a Lutheran too. About
the marriage to Lee Oswald, she seemed to be happy. He had everything she
wanted. They lived on Taft Place in the City Park section, and then after that
they built a home on Alvar Street. That was a new section then. Right now
it looks awful, but at that time it was a growing section, and this was a new
house, a little single house right opposite a school, and it was a very nice place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What's the name of the school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. William T. Frantz, they call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How do you spell Frantz?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. F-R-A-N-T-Z, I think it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There were two children born of that marriage; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; two children, Robert, and then Lee was born after his
father died.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, his father died in August 1939, and Lee was born on October
18, 1939, about 2 months after; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. Lee Oswald wanted to adopt John Edward, but my sister
wouldn't hear to an adoption by him, because she said he had a father, and she
was receiving this allotment for him from him, and she didn't want to change
his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When she married Lee Oswald, I assume her alimony terminated,
did it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think so, but John still received his.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The child support continued?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes; now, what came in between there is what I started to
tell you, about John Pic. That was after she married Oswald. There was a
colored girl working in the grocery store, and John was in there&mdash;he was about
2 or a little over 2 at the time, and this young woman was in the <span class="locked">store&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let me interrupt you there a moment. When you say John, are
you referring to John Pic?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; that was the Pic child, and this colored woman was working
in the store&mdash;you see, Marguerite didn't have any children then, because she
was just recently married or something, so this young woman said to John&mdash;he
was just a baby, and she said, "You're a cute little boy. What's your name?"
And he said, "My name is John Edward Pic," like a child will do, drawing it
out so that everybody could hear it, and she asked this colored girl, "Whose
child is this?" and the colored girl told her, "That's Mrs. Oswald's boy," so
that's how that happened. I gather that she didn't know anything about the Pic
child, and so forth, so anyway, this young woman went home and she told her
mother that a very strange thing had happened in the grocery store, and she
said there was a darling little child in there, and she asked him his name and
he said he was John Edward Pic, and she said, "By any chance, do you think he
would be related to Eddie?" And she had married Eddie, and Eddie didn't tell
her that he had a child, or that he was married or anything, and then this marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
was annulled&mdash;an aunt of mine saw the annullment in the paper, because
she used to read everything in the paper, you know, and she's the one who knew
about it. My sister did tell me the story about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That marriage was a happy marriage, was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. The Oswald marriage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think so, as far as I know. I mean, I didn't get to go over there
very often, but we would visit. I had a lot of children, and naturally I had to
take care of them, and we never did have anything, and of course they had a
car and everything, and at times they would drop by, but we didn't visit too
often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They had a car and they had a home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. What's that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They had an automobile, you say, and they also had their own
home on Alvar Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, they were buying the home on Alvar Street, and during
that time was when Mr. Oswald was cutting the grass, I think, and he took a
severe pain in his arm, and she gave him some aspirin, and in the meantime
she called the doctor, and he said that was the right thing to do, to give him
aspirin and to rub his arm, so then it seemed like he got worse, and while she
was calling the doctor to come out, he just toppled over.</p>

<p>Of course, the house wasn't paid for, and it seems like they had insurance on
their house that Lee never did take care of, or whatever it was, and I think
if they had done that, I think they would have been safe in the house, but he
neglected to do that, so they didn't have no insurance on the house, or whatever
it was.</p>

<p>Then she lived in the house, I think, over 2 years while Lee was a baby, in
this house, and then she sold it. I think she sold it, and she bought another
smaller house somewhere in that area. I don't remember where, and then she
sold that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, hold that for a minute. We will get to that later on.
When Mr. Oswald had his heart attack and died in August of 1939, did your
sister return to work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Not right away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not right away?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I think Lee was around 3 years old when she returned to
work. I never did ask her, you know anything about the insurance, but he
probably had a good amount of insurance on himself, being an insurance man
himself, I imagine. I don't know about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, was that your impression, anyhow, that she did return to
work after a period of about 3 years?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. About 3 years; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would have been around 1942, approximately; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I guess so. Now, I can't recollect what happened with Lee after
that, when she went to work, or where she worked. I know I took care of Lee
when he was that age.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, I would like for you to tell me about that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. When Lee was a very small child?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Around that period when he was 3 years old, during that 3-year
period, was that during the period you took care of him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; that's when I took care of him. I offered to take care
of Lee for her. It seemed like he was&mdash;I don't know how that came along, but
it seems like there was someone else, I think, some lady and her husband&mdash;I
couldn't tell you who they were or anything like that, but they were crazy
about the child. She had told me about that and so forth, but then I met her
in town one day and she was telling me how they felt about the child, but I
told her, I said, "Well, I'll keep Lee for a while, you know, as long as I could."
I offered to keep Lee at an age when he was a very beautiful child. Now, I
wouldn't say he was smarter than any other child his age. He might have been
smarter than some 3-year-olds and so forth, but he was really a cute child,
very friendly, and so I kept him and I would take him to town, and when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
would he would have on one of these little sailor suits, and he really looked
cute, and he would holler, "Hi," to everybody, and people in town would stop
me and say, "What an adorable child he is," and so forth, and he was always
so friendly, and, of course, I did the best I could with him. The children at
home liked him. John Edward and Robert are the same age as my fourth and
fifth children, so&mdash;in other words, I had five children in 7 years, making them
all around the same age, from 7 to 19 months apart, so, of course, everybody
was of school age, grammar school. I had to get my own five children ready
for school, and I didn't have any help on that and it kept me pretty busy, and
that's why I guess it was that Lee started slipping out of the house in his
nightclothes and going down the block and sitting down in somebody's kitchen.
He could slip out like nobody's business. You could have everything locked
in the house, and he would still get out. We lived in a basement house, and
we had gates up and everything, but he would still get out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you mean by a basement house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, that's one that's raised off the ground. The house has a
few steps going up to the door, and it has a basement underneath, which a lot
of people make into living quarters, underneath.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. He was 3 years old when he was living with you
at your house, and at that time she had gone back to work; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She had gone back to work; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What sort of work did she do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She was a saleswoman. I think she worked in quite a few
of the stores in town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Here in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I assume her earnings were small?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. What's that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I assume her earnings were small?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes; they don't pay too much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she do with John Edward and Robert at this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, at that time John Edward and Robert were placed in a
home across the river some place. I wouldn't know the name of the home.
I visited with her one time, and she didn't like it too much, and so she took them
because they weren't keeping their clothes clean and so forth. The children
didn't look the way she wanted them to, and she put them in the Bethlehem
home. That's a Lutheran home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the Bethlehem home for Lutheran orphans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; it's not exactly an orphanage. It's for children who have
one parent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think we will take a recess now for lunch, and we can be
back here at 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>(Whereupon the proceeding was recessed.)</p>

<p>TESTIMONY OF MRS. LILLIAN MURRET RESUMED</p>

<p>The proceeding reconvened at 2 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As I understand it now, Mrs. Murret, Marguerite maintained
the house for approximately 2 or 3 years and reared the boy there and did not
work, and at the end of that period of time, she went to work, and she lodged
Lee with you and your husband and your children; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that extended over a period of how long? How long did
you have him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, I think it was pretty near the time that she married Mr.
Ekdahl. I think she married him about that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was 1948; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. It might have been. Now, it might have been a little before
she married Ekdahl. I really can't remember that. I really didn't know Mr.
Ekdahl. I met him one time. Now, I am trying to orient myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's all right; take your time. Do you recall about when that
was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. When she married Mr. Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; that you had the care of Lee in your home.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That I had what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When Lee came to live with you temporarily; when was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, when he was about 3 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would have been about 1942; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he stayed with you until about the time that Marguerite
married Mr. Ekdahl; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Around that time, or a little before. She might have taken
him a little bit before, a few months before she married Ekdahl. I don't recall
exactly how that was now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She married Ekdahl in 1948; so at that time Lee would have
been 9 years old; isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; that's right. Well, then I didn't have Lee that long; not
from 3 years old. He wasn't with me all that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long do you think it was that you had Lee in your home on
that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I might have had Lee about 2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would that have been from 1942 to 1943, or 1944; somewhere in
there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was 3 years old when he came with you; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. What's that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was 3 years old?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. About 3; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When he came with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How old was he when he left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, he was about 5 or pretty near that age, when he left
me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, that keys in with this information I have. When he was
about 5 years old, did he join his brothers out at the Bethlehem orphanage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He did. He was out there for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he come from your home to the orphanage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I really don't know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I thought there might have been some incident as to why he
was placed in the orphanage with his two brothers.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, the incident could have been&mdash;I don't know if it was that
or not, but maybe it was just that I couldn't take care of him any more, or
something like that; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't have any clear recollection on that score?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do have a sufficient recollection that he was about 5
years old?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. About; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When he left your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you do remember Lee being lodged at the Bethlehem orphanage
home with his two brothers, do you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you visit the boys out there at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I visited out there with Marguerite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was on what; a weekend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think it was. They had a party for the home out there, and
the children themselves seemed to be very happy out there. It's an old place,
but a very nice place, and it was run by a man and his wife. The children were
included in everything, and the doors were kept open. In other words, the
children were allowed to go out and play marbles on the outside, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
went to school, you know, to school in that neighborhood. I mean they weren't
confined or shut in, and they seemed to have a good program of discipline.
Even though they could go out and play in the immediate area, they would
come in when the bell rang for supper, but I mean they were not closed in
or kept locked up or anything. She also contributed to that home, I think.
I don't think they would keep those boys there free.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You're right. In the meantime she was working; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. What was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was working?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She was working; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In some department store or something like that here in New
Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She at one time, but I don't know whether this was the time,
but she worked at a hosiery shop on Canal Street. It might have been one of
these Jean's&mdash;what they call Jean's Hosiery Shop over there on Canal Street.
In fact, she was manager of that store at the time, as I recall, this hosiery store
where she worked. I don't know what happened after she left that place.
That was the time she married Ekdahl, in between there, and she left New
Orleans and went to Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know how long she had known Lee Oswald&mdash;that is, the
father of Lee Harvey Oswald&mdash;before they were married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, John Edward was 2 years old when she married him, so
I figured she must have known him about a year or more. Myself, I knew him,
because he collected at my house, but I don't know whether she knew him at that
time or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know whether she knew him before she and her husband,
Edward John Pic, separated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I doubt it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know whether she knew him during the period of the
separation and before the divorce?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That must have been it. She must have known him during that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give me your reaction to Mr. Oswald a little more, if you will.
What kind of man was he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, he was a very outward man, a man that smiled a lot, I
might say. He smiled a lot, and he seemed aggressive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say he was energetic?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes; very much. He was a good worker for Metropolitan,
one of their top salesmen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he was an outgoing person, you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He seemed to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you call him an extrovert?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; of course, I don't know what happened at home. I can
only tell you from what I noticed when I saw him, you know, but he seemed to
be very aggressive and energetic, and they seemed to be getting along all right,
so far as I could tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During that period of time of her marriage to Lee Oswald, did
you have much contact with your sister Marguerite?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; not very much. Like I said, I had five children myself, and
we didn't have a car; so we stayed at home a lot. Mr. Murret is a man who don't
care to visit relatives too much, and we didn't visit them. They came over when
they would be out riding around; in other words, they might stop by or something
like that, but we didn't do much visiting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your husband's given name is Charles F.; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; they call him "Dutz."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's his nickname?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that D-u-t-z?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; and they put it in the telephone book that way, because
he was in the fight game years ago. He managed some fighters, and they have
a lot of contact with sportswriters, and they knew him by the name of "Dutz,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
so that's why he went and put it in the telephone book, rather than Charles, so
that they would know who he was, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does he still use that name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is your telephone listed in that name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; that's what I said. It's still listed that way. His uncle
gave him that nickname when he was a small child, and I always knew him by
the name of "Dutz." I never call him anything else but that, but his family
always called him Charles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What business is he in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. What's that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your husband's business again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He works as a clerk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there anything else you can remember about Lee Oswald, the
father of Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't remember anything else; no. I didn't know anything
about him at all other than being an insurance clerk and coming around the house
to collect insurance. He sort of maybe seemed to be a little forward maybe, I
thought, but, like a lot of insurance men, maybe it helps on the debits, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was aggressive in collecting the accounts; do you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But not forward in any other respect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I mean he was a gentleman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. As far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know anything about his family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I know nothing about the Oswald family. I only met one
brother who was the godfather of Lee&mdash;little Lee Oswald, you know&mdash;and I think
his name was Harvey, maybe. I wouldn't be sure about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Harvey?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I believe that's what it was, but that's about all I know about
the Oswald family. He's the only one I knew or ever saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know where Harvey Oswald is now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He's dead now. I just saw him one time, and that was after
Lee was born. He came over to the house, and I think they were friendly with
Marguerite and all, but all of a sudden there was no more friendship. I don't
know why.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did this friendship terminate while the marriage still existed, or
was it afterward?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think afterward. I don't know whether there was any friendship
with the Oswald family during this marriage or not. I couldn't say. She
never spoke about it, but I do know, after the death of the brother, they had some
dissension about something. I don't know what, but that ended that friendship
with the Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As far as you know or were advised, that was never repaired,
was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your sister married Mr. Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your recollection of that event is what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you remember about that incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I don't know anything about the marriage at all, other
than what you have told me about it. I only met Mr. Ekdahl one time, and
they were about to be married about that time it seems like, and they say
that Mr. Ekdahl was a sick man and had a bad heart, and he was a little older
than she was, and she didn't seem very enthusiastic about marrying Mr. Ekdahl,
and that's when his sister came down here and she liked Marguerite a lot, and
she said, "Why don't you go ahead and marry him? He is lonesome," and so
forth, so she just decided, I guess, to marry Ed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His name was Edward Ekdahl?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; his name was Edward Ekdahl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is your best recollection that you met him once before
the marriage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's all I saw him; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had your sister talked to you about him prior to the marriage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She spoke to me about him, I think. He was a high salaried
man, that I know, and he did research work for Texas Electric, I think, and
of course I don't think things worked out maybe too well for them, I mean,
about his way of giving her money and so forth.</p>

<p>I guess she thought things would be different after their marriage. You
see, he was sort of tight, I think, with his money. She would go to the grocery
store, but he would hold the money, and of course she didn't like that part of
it, I guess you know, so then she went around with Mr. Ekdahl in his travels
for the company and she also took Lee with her wherever she had to go. And
then Lee became of school age, and she had these other two boys in the Chamberlin-Hunt
College in Mississippi.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that a military school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; and it's a high-priced military school, with beautiful uniforms
and so forth, and she used her own money for these boys to go to military
school. Mr. Ekdahl didn't take on that responsibility. He didn't take on any
obligation like that at all, as far as I know. She said he didn't even take Lee
as an obligation.</p>

<p>Now, whether this was all her idea or not, I don't know, because she is very
independent about things. I don't know, but that's the way I understood it was,
so then anyway, Lee traveled with her all over until he became of school age.</p>

<p>During the summertime she rented a place at Covington so that she could
have her other two boys with her on vacation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where is Covington?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Covington is right out of New Orleans, not too far away, over
the causeway. People more or less use it as a summer resort, and they rent
homes there, just like at Biloxi and Gulfport, and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, it's off in that direction?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; so she rented a place over there, and she stayed there
with the boys in the summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, this was when she was married to Ekdahl; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; she was married to Ekdahl then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they visit you once in a while?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. With Mr. Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; never. She was living in Texas at that time, but this
was during the summer that she stayed at Covington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where was Mr. Ekdahl during the summer when she was at
Covington?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Mr. Ekdahl was traveling for the company, but she couldn't
travel with him because she had the boys during vacation time, and then Lee
became of school age and he had to go to school. Now, at that time houses were
hard to get, and even hotel rooms, I mean, when you were traveling and so
forth, so she agreed to stay over in Covington and send Lee to school in Covington
rather than go back to Texas. Now, whether she stayed with Lee when he
went to school or not, I don't know.</p>

<p>The next I heard, well, she was back in Texas. Now, I don't know about
that, how that came about, but she had this duplex. Now, if she had bought
this duplex or not at one time herself, I don't know, but she had spoke something
about buying a duplex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Here in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; in Texas, Fort Worth. So it seems like&mdash;this is what she
told me; that's how I knew so much of her family life, from what she told me. So
then, she told me that when they left Covington, they went back to Texas to this
duplex, and now, she lived either in the upper or lower part of this duplex, but anyway,
one morning she was outside in the yard and this lady who lived either in the
upper or lower, whichever way it was, came out into the yard and my sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
introduced herself as Mrs. Ekdahl, and this lady answered instead, "You are
not the Mrs. Ekdahl that I know."</p>

<p>Well, you can put two and two together there. Now, I am only repeating
what she told me, so then she got sort of scouting around, you know what I
mean, and she found out different things around there, and she accused him of
having someone in this house while she was over in Covington. So then she
got after him and he denied everything about that, so then she said, "Well,"
and she just kept eyeing up the situation, you know, and one time she found
something in his pockets. He had a train ticket to go on one of his trips, and
she called the place and found out that he had gotten two tickets, so she told
him that she would drive him to the train station, and he insisted that she
not drive him, that he could go alone, but she said, well, no, she wanted to
take him, and he said, no, that that would be too much trouble and silly. Well,
anyway, I think she did drive him there, and when they got to the train station,
I think she thought that whoever it was holding the other ticket had already
picked it up, this other ticket, and was already on the train, so Mr. Ekdahl
picked up his ticket and went on, and I guess she always thought he wasn't
true to her after that, you see, so she said one night she followed Mr. <span class="locked">Ekdahl&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She did in her car, or somebody's car, and John, and I don't
know if it was one of John's friends or Robert's, but anyway they followed Mr.
Ekdahl, and they saw him go into this house, and she waited a few minutes on
the outside, and then she had one of the boys run up the steps, and he hollered,
"Western Union," and when he hollered, "Western Union," this woman opened
the door, and when she opened the door, pushed the door back, Mr. Ekdahl was
sitting in the living room. When he left her, he was fully dressed, but his coat
and tie and shirt was off, and he had his athletic shirt on. He had his coat
and top shirt off and so forth, and he was sitting in there, so she questioned
him about that, and he said he was there on business, which was absurd, because
you know you don't disrobe yourself on business, so that's what started
off the Ekdahl case, and then of course she wanted to get a divorce from him
right away, you see, and that's why I say she's quick, you see, because I would
not have gotten a divorce. I would have got a separation, because he was making
a big salary, and so forth, but anyway, she wanted a divorce it seemed like,
but it seemed like he had connections and he must have gone to get the divorce
before she could get it, or whatever it was. She had gone to her pastor and
told her pastor about it, and her pastor told her that if she would press this
case against Ekdahl, that he would have a heart attack and that would make
her a murderer, that she would be the cause of him dying, so he was in the
hospital, I think, so she went to the hospital to see him, and I think they had
a roarup there at the hospital. I don't know what that was all about because,
you see, I don't know anything about all of that except what she told me. So
then she got a divorce from Mr. Ekdahl, and she settled for not too very much
and it wasn't very long before Mr. Ekdahl died, so that was the end of the
Ekdahl affair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, let me take you back to the beginning now for
a few moments, if you will. We had Lee over at the Bethlehem orphanage
after he left the house; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was there when he was five years old, and he stayed there
until she married Mr. Ekdahl; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, he was in the home awhile first. I mean, he was at my
house, I would say, between 1½ and 2 years, and then I couldn't keep him any
more. I guess there must have been some dissension or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What kind of dissension?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She got angry or something, and I might have told her to take
her child, you know, or whatever it was, so she put him in with the other two
boys in the home then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was quick tempered, would you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, that's what I mean; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She would flare up in a moment; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; you see, she was always right. She couldn't take anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
from anybody, in other words, or you might say she was not reasonable,
and especially in some things that are right, because you can keep doing and
doing and doing, but then you get to the point where the other party never
seems to be doing anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She didn't seem to exhibit a full measure of appreciation that
was warranted, is that what you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I didn't keep the child for anything like that. I kept him
for himself and for the love of God, and so forth, and we liked the child, but of
course we had our own obligation with our own children, and this was her life.
She made her own life.</p>

<p>Of course, I do say that maybe she made it, and then she didn't make it,
because you see, it's just the way things happened. Now, whether she was
the cause of these things happening or not, I don't know, but she seemed to be
a victim of all these circumstances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But they kept repeating themselves, a number of them; isn't
that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; they kept coming along; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, she then married Mr. Ekdahl; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had met him only once, I believe you said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Once; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you at the wedding?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, no; I didn't go to the wedding. They were married in
Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you advised that she was about to marry him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't think I knew that she was about to marry him; no, sir.
I just received a picture of her and Ekdahl on their wedding trip, and she had
written on it, "Happily married," and she sent a picture of the house that they
lived in. It was a very nice place, and they seemed to be doing O.K., you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were they married here in New Orleans, or were they married
in Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I imagine they were married in Texas. Mr. Ekdahl was a
divorced man. I guess he was a divorced man. He had to be. I don't know,
but I don't think he could get married without being divorced. He had a son.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I know he did, and his people were Boston people, were they
not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. I know she met his sister. It was her, his sister, that
sort of persuaded her that she ought to go ahead and marry him. She went
up to see them, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Boston?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You think his sister influenced her a lot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But she was somewhat disappointed in Mr. Ekdahl insofar as
his handling of the family funds was concerned; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I imagine she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I don't want you to imagine. What impression did you
get from what she said to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, she just said that she thought things would be different,
that since he was a high-salaried man, she didn't think she would have the kind
of life she was living, like pinching pennies, and having to ask him for everything
that she wanted. I think she was under the impression that he would give
her so much, or I don't know anything about the amounts, you know, but that's
what I gathered from what she told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, I think you said that he did not assume responsibility
for any of the three children; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's what she said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she told you when she placed her two boys, John and Robert,
in the military school, what was the name of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Chamberlin-Hunt Academy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That she was assuming the responsibility of paying their way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; she did. She always had a lot of character. That I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
say about her, you know, for a woman alone. She would have never done anything
she wasn't supposed to do, even though she was in dire circumstances,
and so forth, but one thing would come on like that, and she would just act up
very quickly, like I told you, if she didn't like something happening or something
you did or said, something like that. Of course, there are always two
sides to every story, and I don't know the other side. I only know one side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say that Lee lived with you from about 1939 to 1941?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I guess it was along in there. It's hard to remember those
dates exactly, that's been so long ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he live at any time at 1010 Bartholomew Street in New
Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; they did. That's the house I was trying to recollect that
she bought, I think, after she left this Alvar Street residence. She bought this
house on Bartholomew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she lived there about a year; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know how long she lived there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall her living at 2136 Broadway in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. What street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Broadway.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 2136 Broadway?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was just a month, about the middle of August to about the
10th of September 1942.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I know nothing of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall their residing at 227 Atlantic Avenue in Algiers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, I don't. That's possibly where the boys were over there.
Is that an orphanage, or whatever it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't know. Is there an orphanage over at Algiers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's not the Bethlehem place, is it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, I don't know what orphanage that was, but they were over
there in Algiers, and then they were transferred from Algiers to Bethlehem down
here in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where is Bethlehem located, this Bethlehem institution?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. It's way down off of St. Claude Street somewhere, way down on
the other end of town. I don't think it's there any more. It could be. It was a
very old place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have said that she married Mr. Ekdahl in 1948. I am afraid
I am wrong about that. I think that was 1945 that she married him, which
squares more with your recollection.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, I think so, because that's what I thought. Lee was around
5, and you had him down as 8, and I couldn't recollect having him at 8 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were right in your recollection. Now, what town in Texas
was it that they moved to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think it was Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They moved to Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that address 4801 Victor? Does that refresh your recollection
on that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, she lived a couple of places, you know. Do you mean after
she married Mr. Ekdahl and moved to Texas, to Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know the address at that time. I just don't recollect
that address, because she lived in some other places too. I really don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall whether she ever lived in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I never knew she lived in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the town of Benbrook, Tex., familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; you see, I hadn't heard from her. You see, she went from
New York to Texas. That was about 2 years later, I think. I just don't know
that. I remember her saying that she bought some property some place in Texas,
and she couldn't keep it up, and she probably mortgaged it to this man on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
rental basis, or something like that, and they had some trouble with that; I
don't know. Don't you get tired listening to this merry-go-round?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Murret, lawyers don't get tired.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. It would be too bad if you did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We are under the impression that they moved to Dallas, Tex.,
first and lived on Victor Street, 4801 Victor Street, in 1945 up until 1946, and
then they moved to Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am not attempting to give you information, now; I am just
asking if you recall that, or if you ever knew that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, that could be; yes, sir; but I thought they had gone to
Fort Worth myself. That's what I thought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't hear much from her during that time, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; during those years I didn't hear much from her. Maybe she
would send a card or a picture or something like that, but we didn't correspond.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say she sent you a picture of the house where she was living
with Mr. Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; and she sent me a picture of herself and the boys around
Christmas time, and that's about all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any pictures of the family, album pictures or snapshots
of Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Of Lee Harvey?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or Mr. Ekdahl.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I have her picture with Mr. Ekdahl when they were married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wonder if you would give that to your husband and let him
bring that in the morning when he comes in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. The snapshot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; and will you look hard and see if you have any other pictures
with your children taken when they were small with Lee, and that sort
of thing? (The snapshot of Mr. and Mrs. Ekdahl was produced by Mrs. Murret
and was marked and admitted in evidence on her affidavit as Lillian Murret
Exhibit No. 1.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't have any of my children with Lee when he was
living with us. I have Mr. and Mrs. Ekdahl. She sent that picture, where she
wrote on it, "Happily married." Like I say, I can't recollect her living in
Dallas, in that home in Dallas. I always thought it was Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It appears now that at least during or sometime in 1946, she
lived in Covington, La., at 600 West 24th Street, and at 311 Vermont Street in
Covington. Now, your recollection of that is that this was in the summer
of 1946; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she brought her three boys together with her there; is
that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At this time, her husband Ekdahl had not joined her, had he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Not that I know of. I assume he was out on his business,
you know, while they were spending the summer over there. He came in
periodically every 2 weeks, or every week, or whatever it was; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was your impression that he was a research man for what
company?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. A sick man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; a research man.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He did research for Texas Electric, and she told me his salary
was over $1,000 a month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which is a substantial amount of money; right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, I imagine so, but sometimes you can get along on $250
better than $1,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's right. Now, let me delve into that a little bit. If it
was $1,000 a month, she at that time regarded it as a very substantial income;
is that right?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you people as well would regard that as a substantial
income; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. We people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, the Murret family.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. My family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; we would think we were millionaires if we had
that much money, but still I think we always did a lot with our money. Our
main reason was for our family. That's why my husband wanted to educate
his children. That was his main reason, because he knew how tough it is
in the outside world, so he wanted them at least to have that much. Of course,
these are children who liked to go to school and who liked to study. You take
this girl out there, she is studying all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean your daughter who is outside waiting for you now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; she is still studying, and Gene he is still studying.
Like I said before, we all worked together to see that everybody got his chance.
John was a top athlete in school, and then he went to St. Louis U.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. St. Louis?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; he was one of the few boys that ever got a scholarship
to St. Louis U. for basketball, but he only went there for about a year, and they
wanted him to play at Loyola, and they kept after him when he came here on a
visit, so he left St. Louis and went to Loyola.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Loyola of Chicago?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; Loyola of New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. St. Louis University, the coach there wouldn't let him play baseball,
and baseball was his love. He was a very good basketball player too, but he
loved to play ball. He even played with the St. Louis Cardinals on a farm team,
but he saw he would never really get anywhere as an outfielder, so he quit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But he was good enough to play on one of the St. Louis Cardinals
farm teams; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. He was a good athlete. He was good at ball, baseball and
basketball, and in fact, he went to Murray, Ky. He was one of the boys selected
from the South. They had a North and South game, and he was selected from
the southern section. It was an all-star game of some kind. He just won a trip
to Rome with the Swift Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He works for the Swift Co. now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. He and his wife are leaving this Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How nice.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He earned it. I mean, he didn't win it; he earned it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you say that while Marguerite was in Covington with the
three boys in the summer of 1946, that Mr. Ekdahl continued in his travels
in connection with his business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I assume he did; that's what he said. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At least he wasn't there with her and the boys?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was your information, that she had her boys at Covington
in the summer of 1946, during vacation, but that her husband Mr. Ekdahl
was not in Covington that summer; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't think he was. I can't say whether he was or not, because
I don't know, but she said he wasn't. I assume he was on one of these
trips he made in his business, and that's why she was over there with the boys,
but I don't know any of that myself. I don't think I even knew she was in
Covington until I met her 1 day in town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Here in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was that during that summer vacation period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she told you then that they were in Covington?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had she not tried to reach you in the meantime?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; she had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is Covington very far away?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How far away is it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, about 100-some-odd miles. It isn't very far away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say anything to you at that time as to how she was
getting along with her husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Nothing. She just mentioned the boys being on vacation over
there, and Lee becoming of school age, and she thought she would just stay
there while he went to school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean the fall term, when she would put him in school in
Covington, La.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did she do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I couldn't say whether he went to school there or not. The
next I heard is when she left Ekdahl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When she left Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then to summarize her life with Ekdahl, she married him and
she took the boys out, the two older boys, out of the orphanage and put them
in military school in Mississippi; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At her own expense?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. So she said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; so she said. That's what she told you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She kept Lee with her; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he at that time around 5 years old?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or maybe a little older?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she had accompanied her husband at least for a time in
his travels; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she had the boy Lee with her and Mr. Ekdahl; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is your impression that Ekdahl did not support Lee, but that
she had to support him; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I thought, at least she told me, that he did not support Lee
either. I thought she told me that. I may be wrong on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Ekdahl a man of formal education beyond grammar school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know anything about Ekdahl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But it was your impression that he was previously married and
had a son; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She met him here in New Orleans; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't know under what circumstances, though, do you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She spoke to you nothing about the fact that he had a bad heart?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, she told me that. She said he had a bad heart; a very
bad heart, I believe she said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the man's sister had come down from Boston, and she
approved of Marguerite, and she urged Mr. Ekdahl to marry her; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they did marry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No children were born of that marriage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't think she was married to him very long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were divorced in 1948, I believe; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I don't know about the date on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But they weren't married very long, and that marriage was not,
as far as you know, an entirely smooth one, was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I only know what she told me. She told me what went on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have already told us about that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; that was the reason for the divorce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had she sold her house that she had here in New Orleans at
the time she married Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I think she did. She sold the Alvar Street home and
moved into the Bartholomew Street home, which was a small house. It was a
very low-priced residence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At 1010 Bartholomew?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then she sold that at a profit; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, that's what she said, and that was something else about
her; she started sort of getting into the business of buying property and selling
it and making money off of it and so forth, but things don't just work out the
way you want them to sometimes, the way you would like them to work out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she also undertake to sell insurance at one time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She said she did. The last time she was here, she said she
was selling insurance, but whether or not she did I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean last fall; when she was here last fall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I guess it was in the fall that she was here; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was before the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She said then that she was selling insurance?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. That was after we hadn't heard from them for a very
long time. I didn't even know that Lee was in the service, and so forth,
and then one day he called me up from the bus station here, but during that
time we hadn't heard from them until he called me from the bus station here
and said he was in town and wanted a place to stay. Now, my daughter's
husband was going over to Texas to a coaching school, I think to coach at
Beaumont High, so we asked him if he would call them when he got over
there and maybe visit and find out how they were getting along, and he did
telephone, but he wasn't able to go out to the house, but they told him that
there had been an accident; that she had been working in a candy shop and
a glass jar fell on her nose, and that she had sustained other injuries. So
he told us about that, and I wrote to her, and I sent her money, and I made up
a box of clothing of whatever I thought she might need and so forth, a lot
of things, and sent them to her, and every week I would send what I could, $5,
$10, or whatever it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was that, Mrs. Murret? Was that in 1962 or 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That was while he was in the Marines, still in the Marines,
because she said at that time she was trying to get Lee out of the Marines,
but his time was nearly up, and she was pleading a hardship case, to get
Lee out so he could give her some support. Now, that was over the telephone,
I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was a telephone conversation you had with her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this then in this spring; the late spring of 1959?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Because he got out of the service in September of 1959.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right, because after he defected here, she visited here.
Now, when I talked to her over the telephone, and she told me what it was
costing her financially and everything, that's when they let him out of the
service, right after that, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; in September of 1959.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir, and so then Lee came home, and she was living in
this one room; so Lee stayed there 1 or 2 days, whatever it was, and then
he said, "Well, this is not for me."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who said that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Lee said that. Lee had money that he had saved. He had
saved over $1,000 or $1,400&mdash;I don't know the amount&mdash;but after he got home
and stayed there 1 day, he said, "Well, this is not for me; I'm leaving."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lee said that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; so he left. She thought he was coming to New Orleans;
so she called me and she said that he had left by bus, and that she thought
he was coming to New Orleans, and that he had worked as a runner when he
was here for a while for Tujague's, and she thought he might be coming here
for that reason, and that he may stop at my house, but not to tell him that
she had called me, but Lee never did stop at the house. If he did, I didn't
know it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he call you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; he didn't call. I never heard from him, and I was waiting,
and I have always felt that if he had only stopped at the house, you know,
this might not have happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you think would have happened if he had stopped by or
called?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think we might have been able to help him get a job, or maybe
we couldn't have done anything; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you would have tried, anyhow.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; anyway, we didn't see Lee, and I had to go out that afternoon
and I was under the impression, I thought maybe he did come, you know,
pass by, and I asked some children in the block if they had seen somebody in
the house and they said yes, that they saw someone with a small suitcase, but
afterward I thought it was the Fuller brush man. I thought that afterward.
So then I didn't know anything any more about Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could we stop there a minute and go back over this? After the
divorce from Ekdahl, did she continue to live in Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, and that's another thing. We felt that if she could have
gotten along with Ekdahl, that they would have all been together. Lee would
have had someone to look up to as a father, and so forth, and things might
have been different, but you can't go by what could have happened. I guess
sometimes you make your own troubles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event, after Ekdahl left and they were divorced, then she
remained in touch with you, but she didn't return here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then, at that time, she would have had her son, Lee, and her
son, John, and her son, Robert, with her; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All living in in their home in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What, if anything, did Marguerite tell you about the way she
brought Lee up; I mean with regard to whether he was to stay in the house
after school, and things like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; she told me that she had trained Lee to stay in the house;
to stay close to home when she wasn't there; and even to run home from school
and remain in the house or near the house. She said she thought it would be
safer to have him just do a few chores in the house, like taking the garbage
cans out and things like that, than to have him outside playing when she wasn't
there. She figured he wouldn't get in any trouble in the house. Maybe she
thought she was making it safer for him by doing that, rather than being out
with other children, but I don't know. I guess that's what happened. He just
got in the habit of staying alone like that. That's probably the time that he
got like that; he was with himself so much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, however, you heard from your sister from time to time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. What's that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You heard from your sister from time to time during all of this
period, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, every now and then, but after she had left Ekdahl, I
didn't hear from her too much. I don't know what went on. I think Robert
worked at some supermarket, and so forth. He had to support the family, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
whatever it was, and then I believe he graduated from high school, Robert did,
and then I think he was in love with some little Italian girl who was a crippled
girl, and she told me that the family liked Robert a lot and they were trying to
get the two together to get married, but she wanted to break that up because
the girl was crippled, but Robert said he loved the girl, but she was thinking
that he was young and he just thought he loved the girl, and maybe if he did
marry her he would find out that he didn't like her because of her being handicapped,
and all that happened in there. I don't know all the details, but, anyway,
Robert went in the Marines, and that ended that. He went in the Marines on his
17th birthday, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The same as Lee Harvey?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; that must have been right after graduation. Robert
was sort of a nice-looking boy, I think, but, anyway, she told me that these
Italian people were trying to make a marriage between Robert and this handicapped
girl. That's what she said. I don't know anything about that, really;
so then Robert went in the marines, and she got a job in New York. They went
to New York about that time, and she got a job with the same people that she
had been working for here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Hosiery?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; it was the same people, but Lee didn't want to go to school
over there; so he was a sort of a problem by not going to school, and one day
when she was at work they came to the apartment and they got him and they
took him off and put him in this place, and she had to get a lawyer, and the
lawyer got him out of the place, and he told her that she had better get out
of New York as fast as she could with this boy, and that's all I know about that
story. And then it must have been on the way back&mdash;I didn't even know she
had went to New York, but anyway, on the way back she must have come looking
for a place to stay here in New Orleans, and she came to my house and we put
her up for I don't know how long. It was during that time that Robert was
getting out of the marines, because Robert met her at my house after she had
been staying there a couple of weeks or a month, or whatever it was, and they
all went back to Texas, and I didn't hear from them for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let me interrupt you here a minute, Mrs. Murret. I will get back
to that again in a moment. According to your story, when Ekdahl died, they
remained in Texas until they went to New York; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I imagine that was after she separated and after Robert
graduated from high school. I assume that was the time she went to New York.
I don't know if I'm right on that or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does the late summer of 1952 refresh your recollection as to
when she went to New York?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. 1952?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; 1952, when she went to New York.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, she was living here&mdash;let's <span class="locked">see&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, she was living in Fort Worth before going to New York,
I believe. Do you think that would have been in the summer of 1952?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I can't recollect that. Maybe if you give me a lead, I might
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the name of Ewing Street in Fort Worth, Tex., familiar to
you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't know that one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does Eighth Avenue refresh your recollection any as to an
address where they lived in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I never heard from her at that address, unless that was the
house that she bought, and she was having trouble with the party that bought
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean she was having trouble with the purchaser?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; he was supposed to pay rent to her. You see, she always
wanted to do everything herself, and he wasn't paying her the rent, and
I don't think they was paying the other, and they lost out on the deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She reported that to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; she told me about that. Now, I don't know if that's the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
same place, the same house or not, but that was one house that she spoke
about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the name Mrs. Beverly Richardson familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I never heard of her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Llewellyn Merritt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I never heard of her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Patricia Aarons?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I never heard of her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Herman Conway?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thomas W. Turner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I never heard of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. While Mr. Ekdahl was living with her, of course, he was supporting
the family, but after he left, then that was left up to her; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She had to support the family when Mr. Ekdahl left; is that
right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She got some assistance from her sons, did she?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I think Robert was working at a supermarket, and she
had to make him give her his salary, and I don't know whether John was in
the Coast Guard at the time or not. I don't think he contributed anything&mdash;John,
but I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it your impression that about that time she was becoming
increasingly despondent with life?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I wouldn't say that. She seemed to be a person, or rather, she
was a person who adjusted very easily to situations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She adjusted easily?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She knew she had to do something about these things; that
she had to get out and work, and so forth, to buy these boys things that they
needed and to keep them going. Of course, I guess it was hard, naturally.
It's hard for any woman, you know, to try to support three boys, and I don't
think they ever appreciate what you do for them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What makes you say that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, she told me that the boys weren't helping out, I mean,
John. Now, I don't know if John was married right about then or not, but I
don't think he was helping out at home at all. If it had been my son, I know
he would have stayed with me. He wouldn't have run out. Of course, maybe
John had a family and maybe he couldn't help, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she talk to you about that, or seem despondent because
her children didn't help her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; she told me about it. Now, after Robert got married,
she stayed with Robert for a while, but I think there was a little friction between
her and his wife, or something. I don't know about that, except what
she told me. Of course, there are always two sides to every story. I don't
know. You can only repeat what one party tells you. In a way, I don't think
those children showed the proper respect for their mother, and I don't think
that's right regardless of the hard time she was having raising them, because
I guess she was a little demanding on them at times, and I think children
should have the proper respect for their parents. I know no matter what my
children did, I would still love them. Mr. Murret is a good family man too,
and there's nothing he wouldn't do for his children, and I have heard him tell
them that no matter what happens don't you ever talk about anybody's mother,
and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it during this period before she moved to New York that
she told you she had, as you put it, trained Lee to stay in the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I don't know exactly when you would say that was, but
I think that's one reason why I know that Lee was so quiet; he was so much
by himself, without playing with other children. She did tell me that she
told Robert to come right home from school and things like that, because she
thought it would be safer than being outside playing, but I don't know exactly
when it was she was telling me that. I think that was while they were living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
over in Fort Worth, but anyway, she was having a hard time of it over there,
and she either wrote me or called me&mdash;I don't remember which, but anyway,
I told her that I would help her out, to send Lee down here for a while, and
she sent Lee by train over here, and the train was about 2 hours late.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did he come from at that time, from Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. From Texas; yes, sir, and I asked him, I said, "Lee did you
meet anyone on the train? Did you talk to anybody?" And he said, "No, I
didn't talk to anybody. My mother told me not to talk to anybody." Of course,
that's a good thing sometimes, not to talk to strangers, but I guess that was
one of the reasons he was so much by himself. Anyway, he stayed with us
for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For how long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. About 2 weeks, 3 weeks, maybe more, until she got on her
feet, and we took Lee out to ball games and bought him things, and we tried
to make him happy, but it seemed like he just didn't want to get out of the
house. I mean, he wouldn't go out and play. He would just rather stay in
the house and read or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He wouldn't want to go out and play with the other children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, he wouldn't. We didn't have a television. Even though
I had a husband, my sister always seemed to have more than I had. She was
working, and somehow she had an automobile and a television and things that
I didn't have. It was years after television had come out before we had one.
We did have a radio, and Lee would take it in the back room and listen to the
radio and read. He would read funnybooks and I would try to get him to go
outside and play with the other children, but he wouldn't go out, so finally I
just made him get out, so he did for a day or so, but then he came right back
in and would go right back to reading and listening to the radio, and I practically
pushed him out again, because I didn't think it was healthy for him to stay in
the house all the time, just to stay in that room by himself, but finally I decided
that that was what he wanted, that that was his way of life, what he wanted
to do, and there wasn't much I could do about it.</p>

<p>We took him out after that, but he didn't seem to enjoy himself, so finally
I told her to come and get him, that we didn't like for him to be there any
more, because we had tried to do all we could for him. Now, maybe she thought
we didn't like him, but that wasn't it. It was just that he wouldn't go out
and play, and he wanted to be alone in that room all the time, and he wouldn't
even talk to the other children, and he was obviously very unhappy, but anyway
she came down and got him. In fact, he told her to come and get him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Because I saw the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He wrote a letter to her asking her to come and get him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I wasn't supposed to see the letter, but I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You saw the letter before it was mailed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he expressed in that letter some discomfort in being at
your home, did he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he was under the impression that you didn't like him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I guess so, because he wrote and told her that nobody around
there liked him, and here everyone was knocking themselves out for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where was your sister living at that time, in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the occasion that she came from New York and stopped off
in New Orleans, did she stay with you for a few days?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, she stayed with me until she found an apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was in your home at 757 French Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; and that address was changed to 809 French Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, it was the same house, but they changed the numbering
of that block, but it was the same residence. They changed it to the 700 block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how long did she stay with you on that occasion?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, that must have been 2 weeks, 3 weeks. She was looking
for a place to stay, and Robert was coming out of the service, and so that's
when she found this place over on Exchange Alley before Robert came in, and
she met Robert at my house, and they went right over to the apartment at
Exchange Alley that she had found, but Robert left. He wouldn't stay in New
Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How many days were you looking for an apartment for her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, I would say about a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Until she found this place on Exchange Alley?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was Lee doing during that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He was going to school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When they came back from New York and stopped at your home
and lived with you temporarily, did he go to school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; he did. That's when she enrolled him at Beauregard
Junior High.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would that have been in January 1954?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, they left New York City, I think, either on the fifth or the
seventh of January 1954. Now, we have an address here in New Orleans of
1464 St. Mary Street.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, that was before the Exchange Place. She rented that from
this lady who was a friend of hers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that Myrtle Evans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; Myrtle Evans. She was a friend of hers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I believe she also lived for a time at 1910 Prytania, didn't she?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think that's right. I'm not sure about those different places,
I mean, how she would move from one to the other, but she was at several
places up in there before she went to Exchange Place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, we appear from our records to have them living on St.
Mary Street in New Orleans in May or June of 1954, until about February
1955.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I don't know anything about that. I know Myrtle Evans
was managing that apartment where she lived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know how it was that she went to live at 126 Exchange
Place in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that 1954 or 1955?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know&mdash;whatever you have down there probably is the
right year, but they lived at Myrtle's house first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could it have been that Myrtle Evans lived, in the spring of
1954, at 1454 St. Mary Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know. Maybe that's right. I know this was a very old
house where she lived. I was told that she had a family home&mdash;Myrtle&mdash;and
that she had renovated it into a lot of apartments for tenants.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did they stay at your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. At my house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, like I said, 2 weeks or 3 weeks at the most, somewhere in
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you are pretty sure that they moved directly from your
house into this place on Exchange Alley?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, either there or to Myrtle's apartment. I don't know
which, to be truthful with you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, tell me about Lee Harvey Oswald during the couple of
weeks that he spent at your house. Did you notice any change in him from
the time you had known him previously? He would now have been about 3
years older; isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; like I said, they had just come from New York, and
she had told me about him not wanting to go to school, but she enrolled him
over at Beauregard School, which wasn't too far from my home. It's a school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
on Canal Street, and it's just a few blocks after you get off of the bus from
Lakeview, so she enrolled him there, and she gave him my address for the
school, and I think, or I'm quite sure, that while he was there he was having
trouble with some of the boys at the school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, will you tell me about that? Just tell me what you are
referring to now with relation to that school.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I can only tell you what I was told. I don't know anything
myself that happened, but I can tell you what he told me, or what he told
her of what happened. He said they were calling him "Yankee," and so forth,
names like that, and this one time he got into the bus and he sat in a seat in
the Negro section, which he didn't know, because he had come from New York,
and he didn't know that they sat in special seats, so he just got on the bus and
sat down where he could. The bus stopped in front of the school, and you can
hardly get a seat anyway, so he just ran to the bus and jumped on and got a
seat, like I said, in the Negro section, and the boys jumped him at the end of the
line. They jumped on him, and he took on all of them, and of course they beat
him up, and so he came home, and that was the end of that. He didn't say
anything to me about that.</p>

<p>Another time they were coming out of school at 3 o'clock, and there were boys
in back of him and one of them called his name, and he said, "Lee," and when
he turned around, this boy punched him in the mouth and ran, and it ran his tooth
through the lip, so she had to go over to the school and take him to the dentist,
and I paid for the dentist bill myself, and that's all I know about that, and he
was not supposed to have started any of that at that time.</p>

<p>Now, at the Beauregard School at that time, they had a very low standard,
and I had no children going there and never did. My children went to Jesuit
High and Loyola University, but they did have a very bad bunch of boys going
to Beauregard and they were always having fights and ganging up on other
boys, and I guess Lee wouldn't take anything, so he got in several scrapes like
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These were things that Mrs. Oswald told you; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; most of it, except when he was in my home, and I observed
the way he acted. He was a lonely boy most of the time, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your children were all entered in school, were they?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did they study pretty hard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have the impression that Lee Harvey was doing well in
school, or what was your feeling along that line?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think he was doing very poor work in school most of the time.
Then he got to the point where he just didn't think he ought to have to go to
school, and that seemed to be his whole attitude, and when I mentioned that to
Marguerite, that seemed to be the beginning of our misunderstanding. She
didn't think her child could do anything wrong, and I could see that he wasn't
interested in going to school, because I have had children of my own going to
school and they always done real well in their grades. They actually seemed to
like school, but I can't say that Lee ever showed that he liked school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When he came with his mother from New York, did he ever discuss
anything with you relative to his trip to New York?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; he never said anything, but my sister told me about the
time they had to take him out of the apartment, when she was working, and
put him in that place, and she had to get a lawyer to get him out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, this boy was about 14 years of age at that time;
is that right, after they returned from New York and stayed at your place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; and then the next I heard was when he came here, and
he didn't want to go to school because he thought he already knew all that they
had to teach him, so she must have allowed him to go to work for Tujague's, because
he had a job as a runner, going from building to building, delivering messages
and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was in 1955, would that be about right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. When he was here; yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did this boy come over to visit you occasionally when they were
living in Exchange Alley?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; he did. Before he got the job with Tujague's, he liked
seafood, you see, and he used to come over from school on a Friday afternoon to
get his Friday dinner, because he knew I always cooked seafood on Friday, so
he always came on Friday, and then he would come again on Saturday morning
and I would give him money to rent a bike at City Park, and you know, he
thought that was one of the greatest things he could do, and he was very happy
riding a bike up in City Park. My children had a bike, but it seemed like he
wanted to go up in the park rather than ride their bicycles, and sometimes I
would have to get my children back or something, and I would have to give him
more money so that he could keep his bike another hour.</p>

<p>Now, when he was going to Beauregard, Joyce, one of my daughters who lives
in <span class="locked">Beaumont&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Beaumont, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; well, I don't think Joyce was married then. I can't
think whether she was or not, but anyway, we went to the store and we bought
Lee a lot of clothes that we thought he might need so he would look presentable
to go to school, you know, whatever a boy needs, and when we gave them to him,
he said, "Well, why are you all doing this for me?" And we said, "Well, Lee,
for one thing, we love you, and another thing we want you to look nice when you
go to school, like the other children." So that was that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he wear this clothing to school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes; he wore the clothing that we bought him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything else with regard to your purchasing this
clothing for him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; he never would discuss anything. He was very independent.
Like one time I remember asking him a question about something,
and he said, "I don't need anything from anybody," and that's when I told
him, I said, "Now listen, Lee, don't you get so independent that you don't think
you need anyone, because we all need somebody at one time or other," I said,
"so don't you ever get that independent, that you should feel that you don't need
anybody, because you do need somebody, sometime you will."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you think that a little of this independence might have
rubbed off from his mother, in the light of your experiences with your sister?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, she was independent herself all right. She didn't think
she needed anybody either, so I guess he sort of got that from her, but I know
that there are times when we always need somebody, and if you don't have
somebody to turn to, then you don't know what to do sometimes. I would hate
to feel that I never needed anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Lee seem to have that propensity, that when you did things
for him, that he didn't seem to want you doing anything for him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't think he seemed to be very appreciative for anything
you did for him. Now, I will say this, at the time he was receiving something,
like these clothes, he seemed to be very happy about it, but it didn't last any
time, and he never would put it in words at least anyway. We were probably
the only people that he knew as relatives. I don't think he knew anyone else
in the family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the Oswald family, do you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. In the Oswald family or any other family. I mean, we were
the only ones he knew, and I got to know him pretty well since I took care of
him while she had the other two boys in this place, after she gave birth to Lee,
but along with him I had these five children of my own to take care of, and I
had a colored girl working for me. When John was born, I had a child that
was just a few months older than John Edward, but I gave her my girl for
weeks, and I was struggling along with my five, and a baby the same age as
she had, you know. I tried to do all I could to help her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you recognize Lee's handwriting if you saw it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't say that I would. I may. I may have expressed it
before, but I thought he had a very childish handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see his handwriting often?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Only at the time when he was going to Beauregard School, with
his homework.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Without noting that you have Commission Exhibit No. 540 before
you, do you recognize that handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Wait till I get my glasses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right; take your time.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I couldn't say I recognized it. It looks a little like, something
like his writing, I mean, the way he would write, but I couldn't say for sure&mdash;I
couldn't swear that that was his writing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You couldn't swear that he wrote this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does it look like what you recall his handwriting was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, if it's anything, it's even a little better than I knew him
to write, I might say. I never thought he wrote very well for his age, and he
was 14 then, you know. Of course, a lot of boys don't write good. Girls, you
will find, are better at penmanship than boys. You ought to see my son's
writing. He graduated from law school, and he don't write good either. Now,
I think he was left handed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you have caused me complications, Mrs. Murret. Commission
Exhibit 540 has a series of pages which are numbered at the bottom,
148 through 157, both inclusive, purporting to be photostatic copies of a diary
or the memoirs of Lee Harvey Oswald, written in his hand, and found by
Irving, Tex., police and the city of Dallas police, or at least certainly by the
city of Dallas police; in his room.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, here's one that says that he was&mdash;you see, when he stopped
in that Saturday, you know, we didn't know where he was going, but he said
he was going to be stationed at Keesler <span class="locked">Field&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that Keesler Field at Biloxi?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. But someone else said that they thought that when he
came to my house on that Saturday, when he stopped there, that he was coming
from Atlanta, Ga., that day, but anyway, we took Lee to lunch that day and
then dropped him off, if I remember right, by the customhouse up here by the
river, and that's all I remember about that, and I never saw him any more
after that until he turned up in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After he defected to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir. I told him, I said, "Lee, if you are going to be stationed
over there, you can come over weekends."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say he was going to be stationed there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. At Keesler Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; he said he was going to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is over at Biloxi, Miss.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; but he never did come over and see us, and he never
did write. I asked him to write, but he didn't write, and I never heard any
more from him. I didn't even know that he was back from Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you didn't know that he had gone to Russia either; is that
right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right; I didn't know he had gone over there at all. I
didn't know he went until after he went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you learn he was in Russia? Did his mother tell you
that he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That he had defected, yes. That was about the time she had
this accident, I remember, and then he got out of the Marines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, that was before he defected; right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; that was before he went to Russia. He got out of the
Marines and he came to see her, and he had all that money, but he didn't give
her any of it, I don't think, but $10. I think he gave her $10, she told me, and
then he left, supposedly to come to New Orleans, so she thought, so I didn't
hear from her any more until she learned by him from letter that he was in
Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So she told you that; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She told me; yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the fact that he had defected prominently displayed in
the New Orleans papers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, not here so much, but in Fort Worth and so forth, over
there, they mentioned it; they made quite a to do about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was nothing in the New Orleans papers about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't think. There might have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, at least it didn't come to your attention?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't think they had anything here about that at all, but
they did have it a lot in the Fort Worth paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she send any of those newspaper clippings to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; she came down here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she told you all about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She told me all about it, what she knew about it. She didn't
know too much about it, she said, why he did it or anything like that, but she
said that he had a right to go any place he wanted to go, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she seem to think he was living in the pattern that she had
brought him up in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. What's that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she seem to think that he was living in the pattern that she
had brought him up in, that is, to be independent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, it's hard to judge that. When you only have one person,
or one child, maybe you do have a tendency to feel that way, but who knows
what's in a person's mind. I think your mind is what really belongs to you,
and I don't think anyone knows what's running through your mind. I really
believe that, so I couldn't tell you how she felt about it, or how he felt about
it, or what made him do the things he did. I can only tell you what I think,
but that doesn't mean that I know, because I really don't. You just can't tell
what's running through a person's mind. You may think you know their mind,
but you don't, I don't think. I think he went over there because he wasn't
satisfied with the life he was living, and maybe he wanted to see how it was
over there, I guess; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any conversations with him about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. After he came back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No. Oh, I spoke about it, and he might say something once in
awhile about how they lived or something, but he never did discuss it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any talks with your sister or with him when he
was working as a delivery boy or messenger boy for Tujague's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No. I didn't know anything other than he was working there,
and he was a runner, and that sort of thing, for them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, he had not yet graduated from high school; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't believe he had graduated from high school yet; no,
sir. He came out of this junior high, and like I said, I didn't even know he
went to Easton. I remember one morning he came over to the house, and
he said that he wanted to get on the ball team, but he didn't have any shoes and
he didn't have a glove, so I said, "Well, Lee, we can fix you up," and I gave him
a glove, but I don't think we had shoes to fit him. Joyce's husband sent him
a pair of shoes from Beaumont, a pair of baseball shoes, and I told Lee, I said,
"Lee, when you need anything, just ask me for it, and if there's a way to get
it for you, we will get it." So then he got on the team, I think, but he got off
as quick as he got on. I don't know why. He never discussed that with
us as to why that was, and we never found out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He never discussed that with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't think he got on the team though. He never did
actually play on it, I don't think. For one thing, I don't think he was the
type of boy who was too good an athlete.</p>

<p>Like a lot of boys, I guess they wanted him to be one of those that sit on
the bench, and he didn't like to sit on the bench, so when they didn't let him play
on the team and wanted him to sit on the bench, I guess he just left. I don't
know that though.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You think that's what happened to Lee, do you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think that's what might have happened to him. I don't know
though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he a competitive person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Was he what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he competitive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't think so. Like I said, at school his only remark
about that was that he didn't think he had to go to school to learn these subjects,
because he knew all of them. He said he wasn't learning anything, and it
was just a waste of time.</p>

<p>I told him, I said, "Lee, that's not the idea. It's not a waste of time. You
have got to go through school in order to graduate, because you need to graduate
to get anywhere in this world." I told him, "You are going to have to go on
to college and make something out of yourself, even if you think you know
all the subjects." I think that's one of the things that Marguerite got a little
put out with me about. She always wanted to let Lee have his way about
everything.</p>

<p>Even after he came back from Russia, I talked to him about that, but he
answered me the same way. He said he didn't see any use in going to school,
that he knew all the subjects.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your children discuss Lee in your presence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Did they discuss Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. What did your children think of Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. They loved Lee, I think. He was in my home, and he acted
like any other boy would act, no different, as far as that goes. I didn't have
television then, so he would eat dinner and then listen to the radio and go to
bed, and get up the next morning and do the same things. Actually, the
children didn't have much contact with him, because he wouldn't go out and play
at all. They really loved him a lot, though. They have always loved him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then eventually they went to Texas; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, was that in the fall of 1956?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They left New Orleans and went to Texas in 1956; right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right. That's when he joined the Marines. I don't
know what that date is, but I know he joined the Marines after they left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your sister didn't tell you and Lee didn't tell you that they were
about to move to Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I think that's about the time that Robert came in, because
the next thing she said was that Robert didn't want to stay here. He
didn't want to make his home here, he said. He said New Orleans was not
his home, but that his friends were in Texas, so I don't know if Robert left
first, or if they all left together. In fact, I didn't know she was leaving until
she rang up one day&mdash;she had a sewing machine that belonged to us, a
portable sewing machine that we had loaned her, and she called one day and
said she was already packed and ready to go to the train station, or whatever
it was the way she was going, and all she said was, "We're leaving; come get
your machine." We never did get the machine. When we went up there,
the place was locked up, and we never did get it back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was a portable electric sewing machine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; she told us she was leaving right then, and to come and
get it. She said she would leave it there in the house or something like that,
or it's in the house or something, and that was it. Like I said, when we got
over there the place was locked up and we didn't get the machine back. She
had some furniture that belonged to her there, I think, so I don't know whether
she took anything with her besides her clothing or not; but she left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where was this she called you from, do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, they were over on Exchange Place at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exchange?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you go right over there to get the machine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I didn't. When we did go over the place was all locked up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So then that was the circumstance, as you knew it, after Robert
got out of the service?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; and came to New Orleans. She thought he might live
here and work and help support the family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But he didn't like New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right. He said all his friends were in Texas, and he
wanted to move over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He said he wanted to live in Texas where his friends were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; that's what he said. He said Texas was his home, not
New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And so they moved to Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; and shortly after that&mdash;I forget when&mdash;but Robert married,
and I didn't even know he was married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't even know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What kind of boy was Robert?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know too much about Robert. After they moved away,
I didn't know too much about Robert, and I didn't know John too well either.
There's one thing. Robert and John, they never recognized one another as
brothers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me about that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. They were stepbrothers, but having lived together from real
small children, you would think that they would love one another as brothers,
you know. You would think being small children, they would accept each
other as brothers and wouldn't think anything about being halfbrothers or
stepbrothers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Except they had two different names, Pic and Oswald; right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me this, Mrs. Murret: do you think that the fact that your
sister Marguerite insisted on John Edward Pic retaining his Pic name despite
the fact that her husband Oswald wanted to adopt him, contributed to that
feeling between the two boys?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I don't think, because John was 2 years old when she
married Oswald, and then Robert was born a few years after that, so I don't
think that would bring that about, but that's what she told me, that Oswald
wanted to adopt John, and she said, "No; John has a father, and his name is
Pic, and let's leave it at Pic and let the father contribute to him."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, perhaps I didn't frame my question right. You were under
the impression that the boys were conscious of the difference in the name Pic
as against Oswald, weren't you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you do recall that each regarded the other as his brother;
isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I think Lee loved Robert a lot, but maybe he wasn't too
fond of John. In a different way maybe he didn't love John as much as he did
Robert. That's just what I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did John and Robert get along?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know. I was never in their presence too much at that
age. I kept them when Mrs. Oswald gave birth to Lee, but they were little then,
you know, and they seemed to be getting along all right. I had them for about
a week, and I remember sitting outside and they were saying that it had better
not be a girl. "Because we don't want any girls in this family."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh well, that was boy talk, was it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes; but they did say, "It had better not be a girl."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you first become aware that Lee had entered the
Marines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, not until he came in that Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When he wanted to be stationed at Keesler Field?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right, that's what he said when he came through on a
Saturday, but then I never heard any more from Lee at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you have already touched on some information regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
when he went to Russia. Marguerite communicated with you about the fact
that he was in Russia; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, like I said, my son-in-law contacted her because we hadn't
heard from her in a very long time, so he looked in the telephone book over
there and found her number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your son-in-law's name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Emile O'Brien. He called her and he told us that she said that
she had this accident, like I told you before, so I called her, I think, or her
brother&mdash;I can't remember which. Anyway, we sent her a box of clothes at
Christmas time, anything that we could think of, and then I sent her money at
different times during the week, as much as I could afford and so forth, and
she said she was trying to get this hardship discharge for Lee so he could
leave the Marines and come home.</p>

<p>It was pretty near time for him to get out, but when he came in, he only
stayed there for 2 days at her house, or 1 day, or whatever it was, and he said,
"Well, this is it; this is not for me," and he left, and that's when she called me
and she said she thought he was coming to New Orleans and that he would be
coming by bus, she thought, and that maybe he would be coming to my house,
but for me not to tell him that she had called me, but I never saw Lee or
anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he contact you at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I never saw Lee or never heard any more from him until
the next thing I knew was when she told me she received this letter, I think,
from Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She called you and told you about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, during all this time that he was in the Marines, he didn't
write you, did he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I never heard from him; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The only time he saw you was on that one Saturday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when he was here on that Saturday, he told you he was going
to be stationed at Keesler Field.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything about what his experiences had been in the
Marines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He didn't say anything. It was a rush affair. He came up
and rang the bell, and he was in uniform, and he said, "What do you think, the
people on the bus thought I was a cadet, and here I am a big Marine." We took
him out to lunch, and we left him off at the Custom House, like I said, and that
was the end of that. But, maybe you might like to know this: before Lee went
into the Marines, while he was in New Orleans and they were going to live on
Exchange Alley, I think he tried to join the service then, a branch of the service.
I don't know which branch or anything, but anyway, he must have gone to the
induction station and they told him that he could sign up if his mother would
sign. Now, he met her in town, I think, and he was all excited and he wanted
to join the Marines or whatever it was he was going to join. I can't remember
if it was the Marines, and he said, "If you will sign for me, I can go." And
she said, "No; I am not going to sign for you," so he was very indignant about
the whole thing, and he told her that she was stopping him from going in, so
then that went around for a while, and then he came back and told her that if
she would sign an affidavit, go to the lawyer's office and sign an affidavit, that
he would be able to get in, so she went around to the lawyer's office with him,
and I think it was in Mr. Sere's office&mdash;he has expired since then&mdash;and Mr.
Sere told her, "Well, since you can't do anything with him, and if that's what
he wants to do, well, go ahead and let him go." So the affidavit was signed for
him to go in the service, so then the next step was that when he got over to
the place&mdash;I don't know whether it was the auditorium or not that they sent
him over with his suitcase&mdash;but the person who was in charge there wouldn't
let him sign up, wouldn't let him go, and that was that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean they wouldn't take the affidavit? They wouldn't admit
him on the affidavit?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right, and so that upset him for a while, but he said very
little about it. And then he met someone in this branch of the service who had
taken a liking to him, and he used to go over there and converse with him about
different things in the service and so forth. I don't know who he was or what
they talked about or anything like that, though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Lee an industrious boy as a high school boy? He didn't seem
to have worked much after school.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, of course, he was a young kid. I don't know what he did
at home. I know I never did have anything for him to do at my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your boys work after school when they did go to school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. My boys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. My boys&mdash;let's see. They always went to school, and during
vacation time, well they had paper routes and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's what I mean.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. One of my boys had a paper route, and he bought about $900
worth of bonds, because I figured that I didn't need his money to feed him, and
by buying a bond every 2 weeks, he would have enough to go to school later on,
and it really came in handy, and then he used to pass out public service bills.
One of my boys had three jobs at one time. He used to go to Loyola, where he
was studying sociology, and he was given a fellowship to work in Father Victor's
office. He was a priest, and he helped the father write a book, so he was given a
fellowship that last year, but he always worked his way, and Marilyn had went
to school and she had worked her way through school too, and Joyce, we helped
pay her way through, but she had to leave school for 1 year and go to work in
order to get back again to school, but now Lee just didn't think he had to go to
school. He said that he was smart enough and that he couldn't learn anything at
school, that nobody could teach him anything. I think his mother thought he
was very smart too, evidently, you know, because she always upheld his brightness,
and he was bright, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he do a lot of reading when he stayed at your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, he didn't do much reading at my house, but she said he
stayed in the room up there where they lived and read all the time, and that he
had this little radio that he had taken apart and fixed, and so forth, things like
that, and he said he didn't have any friends because it was no use, because they
didn't like to do the things he liked to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who didn't like to do the things he liked to do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Lee's friends wouldn't like to do the things Lee liked to do. Lee
said that. Most of the boys had money, you know, and went out on the weekends
with girls and so forth, but Lee couldn't afford those things, so he didn't mix, but
he did like to visit the museums and walk around the front and go to the park
and do things like that, and you very seldom can get a teenager to do that kind of
thing these days not even then. They don't all like that type of life, you know,
but that's what he liked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he inclined to want to be by himself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. What's that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he inclined to want to be by himself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, he said that that was the reason why, because I asked him,
"Why don't you go out with the boys from school?" and so forth, and he said,
"Well, they don't like the same things I like." But I do remember when he was
at my house he used to call some little girl all the time and talk to her quite a
long time on the telephone, and I think he made friends with some boy at Beauregard
School when he was in the Sea Scouts for a while. He had a uniform and
everything. He didn't stay in there too long, I don't think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He wasn't in the Sea Scouts too long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; he wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there a Liberty Hotel here in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. There could be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or the Hotel Liberty?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. There might be; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What kind of apartment was that that your sister Marguerite
had on Exchange Alley?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, that was a pretty nice apartment she had there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On Exchange Alley?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; that was a nice apartment that she had. A lot of people
would be surprised, because with all those poolrooms and everything down below,
it looks like a pretty rough section, but she had a real nice apartment. I know
we read in the papers about, you know, condemning that section where the boy
lived, and so forth, you know, and all that sort of stuff, but they would be surprised
at how nice an apartment that was up there that they had. A lot of
people like to live in the French Quarter just because it's the Vieux Carre, and
because of that reason rents are pretty high.</p>

<p>Anyway, her rent was considered reasonable. She had her own bedroom, and
she had a large living room, and breakfast room and bath. It was a very nice
place, and she fixed it up real nice. Lee had the bedroom, and my sister used to
sleep on the studio couch and she found the apartment really convenient, being
right off of Canal Street and everything. If she wanted to go to the movie, it was
just down the block, and if she wanted to go to any other stores, she was right in
that area where she could go, so actually it was economical to live that close
to Canal Street, so she actually saved money that way, she told me.</p>

<p>Of course, they had these poolrooms and so forth in that section, but I don't
think that Lee ever went into those places, because he never was a boy that got
into any trouble. For one thing, he never did go out. We all knew that he
should have been going out, but he stayed in and read or something. The average
teenager who was going to school at Beauregard would have probably been
in there shooting pool and things like that, but he didn't do that. His morals
were very good. His character seemed to be good, and he was very polite and
refined. There was one thing he did: he walked very straight. He always did,
and some people thought that was part of his attitude, that he was arrogant
or something like that, but of course you can't please everybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But he did have a good opinion of himself, did he not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you hear from him when he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. One time I heard&mdash;it was a postcard, and I think it was the last
Christmas that he spent in Russia, and he wrote this postcard, and all he had
on it was, "Merry Christmas," and he said on it, "Write to my mother," and he
gave me the box number on the card. Now, I wanted to keep this card, but I
had the children at the house at the time, and I laid the card on the side, and
I didn't copy the address when I did write out a postcard to send to him, and in
the meantime <span class="locked">Gene&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's your son Gene?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; he was at the seminary, and they were saving foreign
stamps in connection with something over at the seminary, so he took that card
with him, and after I had written the card to Lee, the children tore it up, so I
didn't have the address any more.</p>

<p>When I wrote to Lee&mdash;I didn't want to write anything in a letter, you know,
so I just wrote it on an open card, but the children tore that up and I lost the
address, so I couldn't write to him at that point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did write a card, but your children tore it up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, my grandchildren; it was just a postcard, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So there wasn't any communication between you or any member
of your family and Lee while he was in Russia, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right. We just got that one card from Lee, and I never
answered it because the card was destroyed before I could mail it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When next did you hear about Lee? I mean now, before you
saw him, when next did you hear about him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I just heard that he was over in Russia, that he had defected
to that country, but they came to New Orleans after that, and then they
went back to Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean Marguerite?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; they were over here after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she live in New Orleans for a while then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She just came for a visit?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she stay with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She stayed with me; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had discussions during that time about his going to
Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, not too much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What statements were made, if any? I mean, what was your
impression?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, she seemed kind of upset about it. I mean, she tried to
get him to get back to the States, but she said he didn't talk to her over the
telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean she tried to reach him by telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir. The paper office over there in Fort Worth was the
one who contacted Lee at the hotel over there, but he didn't talk. He hung up.
I believe Robbie tried to get him back, and so forth, but that's all I know about
it. So then we didn't hear any more from her after she left here. She said
she was going to get lost.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She said that to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. She said nobody was going to know where she was going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know why, so then I didn't hear from her any more until
one day the telephone rang and I answered the phone, and Lee said, "Hello,
Aunt Lillian," and I didn't recognize his voice, and not thinking about Lee, you
know, and I have other nephews, and I said, "Who is this?" and he said, "This
is Lee," and I said, "Lee?" and he said, "Yes."</p>

<p>I said, "When did you get out? When did you get back? What are you
doing?" He said, "I have been back since about a year-and-a-half now," and
I said, "Well, I'm glad you got back," and he said, "I'm married, and I got a
baby." I think he said she was 14 months old, so anyway, he said, "Would you
put me up for a while?" And he said, "I am down here trying to find a job;
would you put me up for a while?" And I said, "Well, we will be glad to, Lee,"
but then I started thinking, because if he had a wife and child, I would have
to make other arrangements maybe, and so I asked him, I said, "Lee, are you
alone?" and he said, "Yes," and I said, "Well, come right on out."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was in May or April 1963; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just about a year ago?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember whether it was May or April, which month
it was.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. It was way after Easter, I know. It was possibly the week
after Easter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, he arrived at your home; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, he took the streetcar and bus, I suppose, to be coming to
my house, and he came out to the house and he was very poorly dressed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How was he dressed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He just had on a sportshirt, and a very poorly pair of pants.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he have a suit coat on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. A suit coat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was your husband home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anybody other than you home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What luggage did he have when he arrived at your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't think he came with anything over to the house. He
could have one of these bags, I mean when he came to my home from the bus
station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, this is particularly important to us. Let me take you
back now to just a year ago, and tell me first of all, as to your recollection of
whether he had any luggage with him when he arrived at your house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I asked him over the telephone where he was, and he
said he was at the bus station, and when I asked him to come out, he came right
on out, and when he came into my house, I think he was only carrying just a
little handbag, they call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What color was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Possibly it was brown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Brown?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What kind of material was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. What the handbag was made of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think it was just cloth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A cloth bag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he have it in just one hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was not a Marine duffelbag or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It wasn't too large, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; it was small.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The witness indicates about 14 inches.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. It was just an ordinary bag, like athletes use to put their
clothes in, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that's all he had on that occasion? You are sure of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. When he arrived at the house; yes, sir. But he had things over
at the bus station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He had a duffelbag and some boxes over there, I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. How do I know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Because I asked Mr. Murret to go over to the bus station and
pick up all that stuff and bring it back to the house, which he did, and they
put it in the garage. He wanted to leave it there until he found an apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did Mr. Murret go to the bus station with Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In your automobile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he picked up the materials at the bus station and other
packages; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you home when they came back from the bus station?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I might have been inside. I didn't go into the garage, if that's
what you mean, but that's where they put the things, in the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see anything in the garage eventually?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I saw a duffelbag out there, and I saw ordinary cardboard
boxes with things in them, and I don't know what was in anything. It
had U.S. Marine written over it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Over the duffelbag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How many duffelbags were there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Quite a few, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. More than two duffelbags?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I could be wrong, but I think there were more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say that there were at least two duffelbags, and
that there could have been more than two?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. I think some of the boxes must have contained baby
clothes and things like that, and in fact, I was wondering how in the world
he got all of that stuff on the bus. I never did ask him, but he really had a
load of stuff with him. It was all there at the bus station though.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he have any long packages with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I wouldn't know that. Do you mean any visible long packages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I didn't see any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These cardboard boxes, were they ordinary cardboard boxes
that a person would pack things in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I guess there were clothes in those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he have any long flat package with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I didn't see any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see any package wrapped in unbroken or tan
wrapping paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't think. Like I said, I knew there were all kinds of
things back in there, all bunched up, more or less. Everything was in such
a little space back there, but it was all together, and my washing machine
is out there, but I never one time pried into or disarranged any of that stuff
or anything like that. I figured that wasn't any of my business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see any package that stood up on end at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I didn't see any like that; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anything that looked like, oh, say, a tent pole, long and hard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I didn't see anything that looked like that. There were
just some boxes and duffelbags and bundles that I saw, and I do know one
time he was back there when I was back there and he pulled out a Russian
cap that they wear in Russia, and boots, you know, these leather Russian
boots, but that's all I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did the Russian cap have any insignia on it, or anything like
that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; the Russian cap had fur on it, like the Russians wear in
cold weather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it have any insignia on it, or a Red star, or hammer and
sickle or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; not that I saw. What struck me as odd that was that
Lee didn't seem to have anything to wear. I told him, "Lee, you don't look
too presentable. I am going to buy you some clothes." My boys were all big,
all over 6 feet, so nothing they had would fit Lee, so he said no, that he had
a lot of things, but that they were all packed. He said that's all right, but
all he had on at the time was a T-shirt and pants, and I think he had only
about two T-shirts with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say he had no suit coat?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; and only one pair of shoes. I even offered to buy him a
pair of shoes, but he said no, that he had some shoes packed away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever get them out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, he didn't get them out. He said he just wanted to put up
there for a few days, you see, because he was trying to find a job, he told me, and
then he said he would send for Marina, his wife, and the child, and I asked him
to tell us what she looks like, you know, to describe her, and he said, "Well,
she's just like any other American housewife." He said, "She wears shorts,"
and so forth, just like any other American housewife, and he said he would have
to have a newspaper so he could scan the want ads and try to find himself a
job, and so every morning he would get up and go through the newspaper
looking for a job, and he would go out every morning with his newspaper,
and he wouldn't come back until the afternoon, until supper time. I had
supper anywhere from 5:30 to 6 o'clock, and he was there on time every day
for supper, and after supper he didn't leave the house. He would sit down
about 6:30 or 7 o'clock, and look at some television programs, and then he
would go right to bed, and he did that every day while he was at the house, and
so then on the first Sunday he was there, he was talking&mdash;we were talking
about relatives, and he said to me, "Do you know anything about the Oswalds?"
and I said, no, I said that I didn't. I said, "I don't know any of them other
than your father, and I saw your uncle one time." I said, "I don't know
anything about the family; I don't know them," so he said, "Well, you know,
I don't know any of my relatives." He said, "You are the only one I know."</p>

<p>Now, this was on a Sunday, and Lee had come to my house on a Monday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Now what he didn't tell me was that on Sunday he must have gone to the
cemetery where his father was buried. That's right at the end of the Lakeview
line, where I live. He went to the cemetery. I guess he went to ask the
person in charge about the grave. Anyway, he found it, and while he was
there he saw someone who knew the Oswalds. I didn't get whether she was
related or not, but they got to talking about the family some way. I don't
know what all they talked about, but anyway, Lee looked in the paper and
finally he found this job&mdash;I don't know where it was, but it was up on Rampart
Street, and they wanted someone to letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. To do lettering work, yes, and so he called this man and the
man said to come on out, so he went on out there to see about this job.</p>

<p>First, while he was waiting for the appointment time, he sat down and tried
to letter, and well, it was a little sad, because he couldn't letter as well as my
next door neighbor's 6-year-old child, but I didn't say anything, so when he
got back he said, "Well, I didn't get the job." He said, "They want someone
who can letter, and I don't know how to do that."</p>

<p>So that's when he got into the subject of the Oswald family again, and he
sat down and took the telephone book, and he called all the Oswalds in the
telephone book until he came to the one person who was the right Oswald, and
this was an elderly lady living in Metairie. She was the wife of one of the
Oswalds, so he told her&mdash;he had a map; he always carried a map with him to
find directions. If he wanted to go to a certain place, he would never ask you
how to get there. He would always take this map and mark the route out
himself.</p>

<p>So he went to see this lady, and she was the wife of one of the brothers in
the Oswald family, and she told him that everybody was dead, I think, and she
gave him a picture of his father, and she gave him some other pictures, and then
she invited him back. He said she was a very nice lady, and was very, very
happy, but I don't think he ever went back to see her.</p>

<p>So the next day, Monday, well, he went back to his job hunting again, and
he continued that way until one morning he saw this job with the Riley Coffee
Co., and he went down and applied and he got the job, and he came home
waving the newspaper, and he grabbed me around the neck, and he even kissed
me, and he said, "I got it; I got it!"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was quite happy that he had gotten work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I said, "Well, Lee, how much does it pay?" and he said,
"Well, it don't pay very much." He said, "It don't pay very much, but I will
get along on it."</p>

<p>I said, "Well, you know, Lee, you are really not qualified to do anything too
much. If you don't like this job, why don't you try to go back to school at night
time and see if you can't learn a trade or whatever you think you can prepare
yourself to do." And he said, "No, I don't have to go back to school. I don't
have to learn anything. I know everything." So that's the way it was. I
couldn't tell him any more. I had told him what I thought he should do, but
if he thought he was smart enough, then there was nothing else I could do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you get the impression when you were talking along these
lines that he really believed he was that smart?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He believed that he was smart; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't think he was spoofing you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I think he really thought he was smart, and I don't think he
envied anybody else. He thought he was very smart, and I don't think he
envied anyone else, because he thought he knew it all, I guess. He didn't think
he had to have a profession or anything else. We didn't even know when he
left this job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, before we get to that, while he was living with you, did he
read while he was home at night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Did he read?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He didn't read any books?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. You see, he went out all day. He would get up and leave early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
in the morning. He wouldn't eat any breakfast. I would try to fix him an
egg and bacon or something like that, but he didn't want anything to eat for
breakfast and he wouldn't take a thing. We always eat a big breakfast in our
family, but he wouldn't eat a thing. He would just get dressed and go out
with his newspaper to look for a job, and come home in time for supper and
then he would sit around a while and watch television and then go to bed, and
he followed that same pattern all while he was with us, until he got this job
with the Riley Coffee Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever talk to you about Russia during that time, his life in
Russia, and how he felt about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; the only thing he spoke about was the relatives. He said
in Russia all the relatives knew one another and he said they all lived together,
and he said if one comes in and he wants to stay overnight, that they will put
him up in a corner, or help him out with clothes and so forth, but of course he
worked in a factory while he was over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he tell you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, he did tell me he worked in a factory and he did work
around the machinery, but that's all he told me about that, but then when he got
this job with the Riley Coffee Co. and started to work there, he said, well, that
was no different than any other factory in Russia. I said, "Well, what do you
mean by that?" He said, "Well, the equipment was just as bad, the machines,
and the work conditions were not any different from Russia," but that's all he
would say about it. We didn't talk about it too much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you mean he inferred that the machinery at the Riley Coffee
Co. was outdated as compared with the machinery in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; as compared with the machinery in Russia, and he said
you had to work hard. He said they work you hard at the plant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything about his reaction to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; he never spoke about Russia that way. He would only talk
when you would ask him a question, that's all. He wouldn't ever tell you
anything. When he first came in and stayed with us. I asked him a few things
about Russia, but he wouldn't talk much about it. He never expressed an opinion
about Russia at all. About all he would say was that they were just about like
any other people. That's about all he would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He didn't talk then about his views on the Russian government?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; not to me. There was no time really. The way things were,
like I said, he would come home in time for supper and then watch a little
television and go to bed, and he never spoke about anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever discuss his life in the Marines with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; he never talked about that either. He did say that he
was wanting to get out of Russia so that he could bring his wife and child over
to this country, and he said the Immigration Department loaned him $365 and
some odd cents, to use to get out of Russia, and he said he worked for the Dallas
or Fort Worth, for some photographer in there, one of those places&mdash;I forget
which&mdash;but he did say that he worked until he paid it all back, and I said, "If
you made that much money on that job, why did they let you go?" And he said,
"Well, they didn't want a third man on the job," or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They didn't want a third man on the job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's what he said, that they didn't want a third man on the
job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you say that was in Dallas that he worked for this photographer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think it was Dallas that he said; yes. It was either Dallas or
Fort Worth. I think it was Dallas. He said he liked the job all right, but
he said they let him go because they didn't want a third man. Now, I don't
know if that's a true story or not. So then he came here to look for a job,
and he said when he found a job, that he would have Marina and the child
to come over here. I think before that time Marina had called, but he hadn't
found anything then, so when he called and told her he had this job, she must
have been all packed and everything, because they got here so quick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, did you hear him talk to her over the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, he spoke in Russian, in the Russian language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say anything to him about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Did I say anything about him speaking to her in Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I didn't, but I did wonder about it, here was a man speaking
in Russian who was an American, and he had had his wife over in this country
for a year and a half, he said, and I did wonder why he didn't try to teach
her English, but anyway, he called her after he got the job, and he got right
off the phone and said, "I am going out and look for an apartment." So sure
enough he found an apartment the very first day, and he came back and he said,
"I have found an apartment," and I think it was $65 a month, he said the rent
was. Then he told me about a Mrs. Paine who he said had been very nice
to Marina who was going to bring Marina on down with the baby, and he
said, "I would like to get a very nice apartment with an extra room so if
Mrs. Paine wants to stay a few days, we will have a place for her to stay."
And I wondered about that too, renting an expensive apartment like he had
in mind, but apartments were hard to find about that time, and I told him,
"If you have a nice apartment, I think you had better keep it, because it's
just temporary," and it was a nice apartment, or at least that's what he told
me. He said, "Do you know how I got that apartment?" And I said, "No,
I don't," and he said, "Well, I'll tell you. I rode around a while, and I decided
to stop at Myrtle's house&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's Myrtle Evans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, he said he stopped at Myrtle's house and went up to
the door, and she came to the door but she didn't recognize him, she didn't
recognize Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was telling you this; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; he told me how he did that, and he said he asked Myrtle
did she have an apartment, that he was looking for an apartment for his
wife and baby who were coming from Texas, and so Myrtle said, "Well, I'm
sorry, but I only have an apartment on the second floor, and I don't think that
would be good, you know, for your wife." Lee said to her, "Do you know who
I am?" and she said, "No." And he said, "I am Lee Oswald." She said, "Well,
don't tell me! Lee, I would never have recognized you." She said, "The last
I heard of you from your aunt, she told me you were in Russia," because I did
see Myrtle one day and she knew me. I never was what you would call a friend
of Myrtle, but of course she knew who I was, because we got to know each
other at a card party where I was working at Jesuit's, and she asked about
Lee at that time, and I told her that Lee had defected to Russia. So she told
Lee that the last time she had heard of him, he was in Russia, and he said,
"Well, but I am back, and I am married to a Russian girl." So Myrtle says,
"Well, come on, Lee," and I think she gave Lee some lunch, and then she decided
to help him find an apartment.</p>

<p>She told him, "We are not going to a real estate office, because prices are
high, and I know because I manage apartments myself, so we will just ride
in and out the streets and see what we can find." So they got in her car and
went riding up Magazine Street, and there was a sign on a house, apartment
for rent, and so they went and knocked and inquired about the apartment,
and the lady said how much it was, and it was very clean with a new stove and
a new refrigerator, and it was newly wall papered and it had a floor furnace
and a large living room and a bedroom and bath connecting the bedroom, and
another small room and kitchen and a front porch, and a closed-in yard, and
so Myrtle said to Lee, "Lee, this is great. You had better take this place."
Well, Lee said, "Well, I don't know. The ceilings are high and Marina doesn't
like high ceilings," but she said, "Well, I think you had better get this place,
because it's all you can afford," so he said he would take it. But I don't think
Marina ever liked high ceilings, but anyway, after he called Marina, then they
came in on Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me for interrupting, but before we get them coming in,
did he ever say anything to you as to why he left Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Did he say why he left Russia?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He never did say why; no, sir. I was always under the impression
that he was just tired of being over there and wanted to come back.
We were trying to find out how in the world he got out with a Russian wife,
and I asked him that question, and he told me that Immigration had loaned
him the money, and he said that Marina's uncle had helped them to get out, and
that he was a retired army general.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have the impression that he was, oh, never quite satisfied
with anything when he was in Russia, that when he was over there, he didn't
like it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, he didn't say that to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, now you say that Marina then came to New Orleans
after he had called and said that he had found a job; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; she came with Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Mrs. Paine drive her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; they came in Mrs. Paine's car. In fact, I think he got
that apartment possibly on a Thursday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At 4905 Magazine Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; Thursday or Friday, or whatever it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was the ninth of September 1963; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I guess that was the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Lee move in on Monday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; Lee moved in right away, on Saturday. In fact, he moved
in on the 10th, I think, or the 9th. Anyway after he got it, he moved in himself
the next day, and then Marina came in on the Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, Saturday was the seventh, Sunday was the eighth, and
Monday was the ninth.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Of May?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, I am looking at September; I'm sorry. Now, let's see.
The 9th of May was on a Thursday, and that's when he got the apartment, the
9th of May, and he moved in the next day; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right, and he came back to my house on that Saturday
morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's the 11th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; and Marina and Mrs. Paine were coming in on Saturday,
and they arrived there about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, around that time, and
then he took all the things he had out in the garage over to the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you present when he did that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I went to see the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But were you present when he took the things out of your
garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. You mean in the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't get any better look at all the things that he had in
the garage than you had that first day when your husband brought that stuff
from the bus station and it was put in the corner of the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I didn't. I was busy on the inside of the house when
he took all that stuff over to the apartment, because we were all anxious to
see&mdash;not all, but Marilyn and myself, wanted to see the apartment, so inasmuch
as we had to bring the things up there, he loaded the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; our car. Mr. Murret drove the car up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see them put the things in the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; but they did put everything in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see them do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; but Mr. Murret helped. I knew he was doing that. He
had to do that. I didn't do it. I just wanted to go over there that first day
and see the apartment, so I was trying to finish up inside, and I just noticed
that he was loading the car, and that's something else, the reason why Mr.
Murret is considered just such a gentleman. No woman in his presence ever
picks up a package or anything like that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A woman never picks up a package in the presence of your
husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right, he always does it. So anyway, we brought Lee
up to the apartment, and he was so happy about the place. He thought it was
a most beautiful place, and we thought it was nice too, but after they got everything
out of the car, we just left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see them taking things out of the car and bringing them
into the apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; but we didn't help them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was your husband helping to unload the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes; he was taking the things out himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You saw him doing that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes; they had a lot of locker space in that apartment, and
Lee was putting everything in this one big locker, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your husband have any luggage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Luggage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I think he had some suitcases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He had some suitcases?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; they looked like Marina's suitcase, for one, because he
didn't come into my house with any suitcase. Like I said, he just had that little
bag with him. In fact, he only had maybe two pairs of socks and two T-shirts,
and two pairs of pants, and nothing else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you did see a suitcase or more than one suitcase in the
garage; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think I did. I think he did have a suitcase in the garage,
and maybe two; yes, sir. I seem to remember those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a ready recollection of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I do. I think, if I remember right, that I saw two suitcases
there, and that they were very nice suitcases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of ordinary size, would you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think they were of ordinary size; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Regular suitcases with the handle in the center?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say they were straight sided and oblong rather than
square?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; just ordinary regular clothing suitcases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About 28 inches long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you didn't see any long package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By long, I mean something in the neighborhood of 45 inches long,
or something like that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I didn't see anything like that. The only reason I noticed
these suitcases was because my washing machine was in the garage, and I had
to go out there to wash, to do my washing, and those suitcases were standing
up, sitting right next to one another, and there were boxes, a bunch of stuff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There were two suitcases, as far as you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. As far as I know; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could there have been three?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. There could have been. There could have been four; I don't
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But your immediate recollection is that there were two?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; that's right. There were at least two suitcases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you didn't notice any wrapped package, any brown butcher
paper, or regular delicatessen store paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I didn't see anything like that. Like I said, though, when
they put his things in the car, I was inside the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your boy do any hunting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. My boys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, the boy that's in the seminary, he did a little duck-hunting
occasionally, but that's about all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your boys ever have shotguns or rifles around your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, they had a small rifle in my locker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know what that rifle looked like?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; just an ordinary rifle. It wasn't an expensive rifle. It
could have been just a plain shotgun, I guess. In fact, I think, if I can remember
back, I think Gene, when he was duck hunting once, almost shot his hand off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you don't remember seeing any package, any oblong package,
out in the garage among those things that Lee had brought in there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you have any conception of what a rifle would look like
when it is disassembled, what the barrel separated from the stock looked like,
and so forth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I'm afraid I don't know anything about rifles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, we are on the 11th of September, and Marina
and Mrs. Paine have arrived at your home. Now, will you tell me about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, they arrived that afternoon. We brought Lee to the
apartment that morning, and Lee stayed at the apartment and came back later
during the day, and I said to Lee, "Well, suppose we go out and buy some eggs
and have your refrigerator stocked," and he had said "Oh, don't worry about
that; I will get all of that. I will have all of that in." In other words, you
couldn't help him, so then he came over to the house, and I planned on having
a lunch for Marina and Mrs. Paine, and they came on in with the baby, so there
was Mrs. Paine with her two children, Mr. Murret, and I guess Marilyn was
in the back getting ready to go out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Marilyn is your daughter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Marilyn is my daughter; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She is a young lady who was here this morning with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, she was getting ready to go out. She had an appointment
with someone, so they came in and when I saw the baby, I forgot who else was
there. I said, "Well, she's darling," you know, and the baby began to cry and
it cried and cried, and Marina took it to the kitchen and took care of her, and
I think John was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean your son John?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I think he was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had Lee arrived in the meantime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Lee had arrived; oh, yes, he was there. So finally Lee said,
"Well, let's go over to the apartment," and so they all got ready to leave, and
Mr. Murret said he would lead the way because they didn't know the way.
He said, "I will lead the way to this place," so that's the way they went over
there. Mr. Murret, my husband, took Lee with him, I think that's right, and
Mrs. Paine drove the others over in her car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From the time that Mrs. Paine drove off from your home, did you
see Mrs. Paine any more?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir; I never saw Mrs. Paine any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How soon after that did you see Lee and Marina and the baby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, you see, I don't drive myself, and I wanted them to come
over, but they didn't have a car and they didn't want my husband to go and
get them, so it was 2 weeks before I saw them again. But one Saturday
morning about 2 weeks after they moved over there, Lee came over with Marina
and the baby, which is a very long way they had to come by streetcar and bus,
and it must have taken them a long time, because they were living up on Magazine
Street, and that's a pretty long way out to my house. From Canal Street
up to the 4900 block of Magazine Street, that's 49 blocks, and then from my
house to Canal it must be 50 blocks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean it was 99 blocks distance from your house to their
house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, they made this trip by streetcar and bus, and we didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
even know they were coming, and they had the baby stroller and everything
that belonged to the baby with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is Lee and Marina, now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was 2 weeks later that they came out to your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; and the baby. I was trying to make friends with the
baby and the baby was crying. It looked like the poor child never saw anyone
before in her life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had this feeling, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have reared some fine children, and you have grandchildren?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it you have a knack with babies and children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you seemed to have trouble with Lee's baby, with this
baby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; naturally she had never seen me before, and she didn't
speak the English language. Marina made her understand things in Russian,
and so I took the baby outside with me to make friends with the baby and
she kept crying, and Marina kept telling her to look at me, and after a while
she made friends, you know, and so then Lee decided that they would go out.</p>

<p>I had a baby bed in the house which I have for all my children, and my
daughter still uses the baby bed, so anyway, Marina and Lee wanted to go to the
lakeside which isn't too far from my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the lakeside?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Pontchartrain Lake. I guess that would be about 12 blocks
from where I live.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About a mile-and-a-half?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. About that. They decided to go crabbing, and so they got a
net and some crab bait, and the baby meantime went to sleep, so Lee left the
baby with me in the crib, and they went out to the lake.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did they get out there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Marilyn drove them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your daughter Marilyn?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; she drove them out to the lake.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Lee know how to drive a car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't think he did. I never saw him drive a car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have never seen Lee behind the wheel of a car, operating an
automobile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever hear that he did know how to drive an automobile,
though?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't think he did, because when they went to New York,
when he went with his mother, she drove, she always drove. I never knew
him to drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So anyway, Marilyn took them out to Pontchartrain Beach, and
they went crabbing; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right; and they didn't get any crabs, so on the way back
Marina was fussing at Lee in Russian, and Marilyn must have said, "Well, what
is she saying?" you know, so Lee said, "Oh, she's just like a woman; she's no
different. They are no different whether they come from Russia or France or
some place in Louisiana. They are all alike. They don't appreciate what you
do for them." Marina was telling him that it was so stupid for them to be
taking these crab nets, spending $1, I guess it was, for everything, when he
could have gone to the French Market and bought a dozen crabs for $1.25 or
$1.50. She didn't see any sense in spending money and going out and not catching
any crabs when you could go and buy them at the French Market. She
missed the point where the boy liked to do that for pleasure. She thought it
was a bum idea. She told Lee it would be better to just go and buy some crabs
and not go through all that trouble, but anyway they came back home, and
they stayed until about 10 o'clock. They ate supper, and so forth, and the
baby got a little friendlier. They played ball with the baby, and she came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
around a little bit, and I think Mr. Murret drove them home, and that was it.</p>

<p>When they left, we told them that at anytime when they wanted to come over
again to let us know, and Mr. Murret would be glad to come and get them, but
Lee said, "No, we don't mind coming on the bus," but then I don't think they
came around for a while after that. In the meantime he must have lost his
job at the Reily Coffee Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you learn that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, he told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did he come to tell you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He called me and again he said they just didn't need another
person on the job, that they had too many. That seemed to be the only excuse
he gave for losing a job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was what he told you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Why he had lost his position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. That's why he said he lost it in Texas. He asked me if
he could use my telephone number, because he would be out looking for a job,
and if anybody would call, then he could call every afternoon to find out if
anyone called, and I could give him the message, so he had his name in at the
Louisiana Employment Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Louisiana Employment Service?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that State?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. State employment, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right; go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. During that time he was getting State employment from Texas,
from that job, when he first got here, because he got one of those checks when
he was at my house, and then he was collecting State employment while he was
off of this job here, when he got out of work, so he was probably collecting both
checks at the same time. I don't think he ever found a job even though he
supposedly was trying, after that one, I mean. He said he was looking for a
darkroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. A photographer's job, or something like that, so he went down
to a place in Metairie, but he had to drive a truck for that job, and he told me
he couldn't take the job because he didn't know how to drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He did tell you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That was when he was out looking for a job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He told you he couldn't drive then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; he said he couldn't take that job because he would have
to drive a truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would have been in the summer of 1963 now; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes; while he was here. I don't think he ever found any
other job after that here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know how long he stayed on this job at the coffee plant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't. There's something else. Before he got this job
at the coffee plant, I think he had Mr. Murret loan him $30, or maybe $40, to
pay part of his house rent, but after he got that job at the coffee plant, he paid
that back to Mr. Murret. I told him, "If you need anything, Lee, ask for it,"
because sometimes I felt guilty. I thought maybe when people like that need
something, we should go ahead and get it for them, but then I told myself, "Well,
no, since he is the type of person who is so independent," so I just stood back
and waited to see if he could bring himself to come to me for something, because
it was apparent that they needed a lot of things, him and Marina, but he never
did, except for that loan he made from my husband to pay part of the house
rent and the time he asked if we could put him up for a week while he looked
for a job, but otherwise it seemed like he didn't want anybody to do anything
for him. I did ask him several times if there was anything we could do for
them, or get for them, and he would said, "No; we have everything," and then
one time I offered him a spread, and he said, "No; we have everything," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
the funny thing was that when they came that Saturday, he said to me, he said,
"Marina says we will take that spread now; we don't have a spread," so Marina
must have bawled him out for not taking the spread in the first place. I mean,
she must have thought he ought to have accepted it. So they went home with
the spread after all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was when they first came?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. So then he would call in to find out if anybody had called
from the employment agency. He had his names in at a private agency, besides
the State employment, and he did get several calls and I gave him the message.
One time I remember the man left his name, but I wouldn't remember that now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Might your husband remember that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No. My husband was never around when all this was going on.
My husband couldn't tell you anything, so then I went away. I went to Texas
for 2 weeks. I left on July 1 and I returned on July 14.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To visit your son?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; my daughter, in Beaumont&mdash;Joyce. That was on July 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had Lee lost his job by that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He must have. I didn't know it, but he must have in between
that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. While you were away, he lost his job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. It could have been in between that time; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything to you about losing his job, that you recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; it was a long time after that that he said anything to me
about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He didn't say anything to you for quite a while?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; he didn't say anything to me about losing his job for a
long time, so then Joyce came back. She had two adopted children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Joyce is your daughter, who lived in Beaumont?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. You see, Joyce can't have any children, so she adopted
two children. One is 4 and one is 5, but she got them when they were a month
old, and they really are adorable. Now, Joyce, hadn't seen Lee before, you see,
or anything, and so then Lee and Marina came over one day while Joyce was
at the house with the children. They had come at about 9 o'clock that morning,
and stayed till 9 or 10 o'clock that night. I was exhausted trying to entertain
Marina, you know, and not knowing how to speak Russian, or make any signs
that she would understand, and so forth, but she liked the dinner, and she
wanted to know how to cook some of the things that I had, and Lee wrote the
recipes down on paper for her, and I asked them how she could tell to pick
out cans when she went to the store if she couldn't read English, and Lee said
she could tell by the pictures on the cans what she wants, but I don't think
Lee liked too much variety in food, just certain things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say anything to her at any time, or to Lee, about the
fact that she wasn't speaking more English than she evidenced?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I asked Lee about that. I said, "Lee, how does Marina
like America?" and he said to me, "Well, you can ask Marina yourself," so I
said to Marina, "How do you like America?" and she said, "Oh, I like America!"
She said, "I like it; I like it!" Now, we always did think it strange that Lee
didn't seem to care whether Marina learned to speak English or not. He was
always talking to her in Russian, and we didn't know what was going on,
you see. I asked him, "Why don't you teach Marina more English?" but he
didn't pick it up, so then&mdash;in August, I think it was, I was operated on for my
ear, and during that time Joyce was home. They had been at the house before
the operation. They knew I was going to be operated on, and he came up
there to see me, which I thought was very nice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. I was at that time at the eye, ear, nose, and throat
hospital, and he said, "How are you feeling?" and I said, "All right." He
stayed just a couple of minutes really, and he seemed to be nervous&mdash;like, you
know&mdash;and I thanked him for coming, and then he went off, so that night
Joyce came back to the hospital again. That was a Thursday, I think, and I
got out on a Saturday&mdash;that following Saturday, so Mr. Murret was not there
for my operation. He wanted to stay, but he was supposed to go to a retreat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
at Manresa, and he missed last year, because he couldn't get off from work,
so I said, "Well, don't miss it this year, because this isn't serious, and there
are no after effects." I said, "Go on to the retreat, and it will be all right,"
so he went, and John, my son, was in town, and he came up, and of course
Joyce couldn't do too much, because she had two children of her own to take
care of, but anyway I had the operation, and Joyce was to come up and get me
on Saturday at about 11 o'clock, so then Lee called, and this was before Joyce
left home to come up to the hospital, and he told Joyce that he was over at the
Parish jail, or something, the one on Rampart over there, and he told her he
wanted her to bring some money up and get him out, and she said, "Mother,
I don't want to." She said she had been there twice with the money in her
hand, and each time she came back out again. She told me, "I don't know what
to do." I said, "Well, Joyce, I don't know what he's in there for; do you
know?" and she told me that she had talked to this officer up there, and she
asked him, "What's that kid in there for, before I bail him out?" She was
going to give the money to this officer to get Lee out, but the man told her not
to be foolish and give her money up like that, because she might not get it
back. She said he told her, "Don't give up your cash because you may never
get it back." He said, "Have somebody parole him." So Joyce didn't know
what to do. She had been out of New Orleans a long time, so she didn't know
what to do. This officer showed her the sign that they said Lee was carrying,
and on it it had, "Viva El Castro," so when Joyce saw that, she said, "Oh, my
God," she said, "I am not about to get him out of here if he's like that," so
she didn't know what to do, but she didn't give up her money. She said,
"Here he was supposed to be out looking for a job, and he was doing things
like that, walking up and down Canal Street all day long with signs and
everything."</p>

<p>This officer told her that he had told Lee, "If you want to carry these 'Fair
Play for Cuba' signs around, you are going to have to rent yourself a hall, and
have your meetings in the hall," and he said, "But you can't carry signs like
that in the business district."</p>

<p>The officer said that what he was doing wasn't so bad, but Joyce thought it
was terrible, you see, so Joyce came on out to the hospital. She didn't get him
out of jail. She didn't give up her money. So when we got back home, it
wasn't long until he called on the phone again, and the first thing he did was
get kind of rude with Joyce. He wanted to know how come she hadn't gotten
him out yet, and didn't she have the money, and she said, "No, I don't have any
money." She said that she had just gotten her mother out of the hospital and
used up the money, and she told him, "I don't have any money to get you out
of there."</p>

<p>Also, Joyce had found out that he had been in there since Friday. You see,
Joyce was under the impression that he had just gotten in jail, so Joyce asked
him, "How long have you been in here?" and he said, "I don't know how long
I have been in here," and Joyce said, "I know; you have been in here all night,"
and he said, "Well, just come and get me out," and Joyce said, "Well, I don't
know; I'll have to think this thing over," and then she said, "I don't have
any money," and then he said, "Well, I'll tell you what you do." He said,
"I want you to go out to the apartment and see Marina, because Marina has
$70.00 and you tell Marina to get that money and come and get me out,"
and Joyce said, "Well, I have to get mother into bed, and I have no one
to keep my two children while I run up there," and he said, "Well, ask
one of the neighbors to mind the children," so in the meantime Joyce told me
what he had said, and I told her, "Well, I don't know. I don't like to exactly
ask for favors from the neighbors like that," so she said she didn't know what
to do, so we talked about it awhile, and then we decided to call this man that
we knew, and we called him, and he told us what had happened, that Lee had
had a fight with some Cubans, and everything, and we were still wondering
what to do about Lee being in jail and everything when, a little while after
that, he called back and said that everything was all right, that Lee was out.</p>

<p>Now, we didn't see Lee though. I guess he went on home. Then Mr. Murret
came back from Manresa on Sunday evening, or Sunday night I believe it was,
and when we told him about it, he was horrified, you know. He went right out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
to their apartment to talk to Lee, and he asked Lee in a fatherly way, what
was he doing, you know, who he was connected with, and so forth, and whether
he was with any Commie group, and Lee said no, he wasn't, and Mr. Murret
told him, he said, "You be sure you show up at that courthouse for the trial,"
and Lee said, "Don't worry, I'll show up," and he told Lee, he said, "You ought
to get out and find yourself a job." "You have a wife and child and one coming,"
and so forth, and then we didn't see Lee any more until Labor Day, I believe
it was.</p>

<p>Lee called up that morning, and he said he and Marina wanted to come over
that day and spend the day, and I said, not right away, but suppose they come
over around 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon, because I think I was busy that
morning, or something, so they did. They came on the bus, and Mr. Murret
happened to be passing by, and he picked them up and brought them to the
house, and I asked them if they had had dinner, and they said yes, but I don't
think they had. I told them I would go up to the store and get some rolls, and
we could have some coffee and rolls, so I did, and I made coffee, and we sat
down and ate the rolls, and to tell you the truth, I don't think they had eaten
anything, because they ate up all the rolls.</p>

<p>I made hamburgers too that night, and they each ate two hamburgers. John
was there too. After they finished eating, it was time to take them home, and
John brought them home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In his car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. I might say too that Mr. Murret talked to Lee quite a
bit about him not trying to teach Marina how to speak the English language.
He said, "Lee, we love Marina very much, but we feel very bad that we can't
converse with Marina, because you speak to her all the time in Russian, and
we don't know what is going on and she doesn't know what is going on with us.
Don't you think you should teach her the English language?" and Lee said,
"No." Then he said, "I'll tell you right now, I will never teach it to her," and
then he said, "I don't care if she wants to learn, but she is not going to learn
from me." He said, "I am not going to teach her, because I don't want to lose
my Russian," but he said he didn't object to her learning the English language,
but at the same time he kept on talking in Russian to her.</p>

<p>I asked him, "Why do you want to keep up your Russian, Lee; do you intend
to go back to Russia?" but something happened right then&mdash;somebody did something
or other, and he never did answer that question, so that was all of that.
So we brought them home. John brought them home in his car, but before he
took them home, he drove them out and showed them the church that he was
going to be married in, and he also took them up on Palmer Avenue and showed
them the home where he was going to have the reception with his girl friend,
at her house. It's a large home on Palmer Avenue, so he took them and showed
them all of that, and then he took them home, and we didn't see them any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the last time you saw either one of them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any contact with them by letter, telephone, postcard,
or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, nothing. Then the next day or the day following that, two
men came to the house from the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was Labor Day, was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No. Labor Day was the last day I saw them. This was a few
days after Labor Day, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After Labor Day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. They came to the house and knocked at the door, and I
went to the door, and they didn't tell me who they were at first, but they
approached me, and asked me, "Does a young couple live here?" and I said,
"No; no young couple lives here, nor did any young couple ever live here," and
then they asked me, "Do you know Lee Oswald?" and I said, "Yes, I do;
he's my nephew," and he said, "Well, do you know where he lives?" and I
said, "Well, yes, he lives in the 4900 block of Magazine Street. I don't know
the number, but it's in the 4900 block," and then they told me who they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's when they told you they were FBI agents?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. Then the next day they came back, and they told me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
that a lady, a neighbor, or whoever they heard it from, said that a lady with
a station wagon was there. I said, "Well, probably that's the same lady who
brought Marina here from Texas, and took them back to Texas."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was the 20th of September, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, I think so, and that's the last I knew of them. I never
heard anything else about them, but now, I skipped over something&mdash;in between
that time he called one time, and he said Mrs. Paine was going up to see her
relatives, I think, and that she was going to pass through New Orleans and
visit with them, but he didn't say that they were leaving with her and going
back to Texas, or anything like that. He just said Mrs. Paine was going to
come through here and visit with them. He also said that Mrs. Paine knew
a Tulane professor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A Tulane professor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; a Tulane professor. He could have been a language
professor, I imagine, because I remember him saying that he had a daughter
that was attending the university in Moscow, and they either went to his home
or they came over to Lee's house. That I didn't get straight, and he showed
slides, and so forth, on Russia, the way I understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who showed the slides?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. The professor, but I think Mrs. Paine was the one who knew
the professor and all that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say his daughter is in school in Moscow?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He is supposed to have a daughter in the university over there,
yes, sir; or he did have. That was my understanding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Moscow?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think he said Moscow, but that's the last I heard from Lee
Oswald and Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, tell me one thing you left out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. What's that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The trip over to Mobile.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh. Well, that came in&mdash;I don't remember the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it sometime in July or August of 1963, somewhere around
there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, Lee wasn't working about that time, and my son Gene
was over in Mobile, and he hadn't seen Lee for a long time, and he had asked if
we could bring Lee over so he could see him. Gene had graduated from
Loyola and had went into the Service. He was in there for about 3 years,
and when they were activated, they went into Germany and everything, and
when he came back he entered law school and went to law school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At Loyola?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, for 3 years, and then he decided to become a Jesuit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A Jesuit priest?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. So he was over at Mobile by then, and naturally when
I wrote to him I told him about Lee, and he said he would like very much to
see Lee, and that he would like for Lee to come up there and bring Marina up
and visit him, so we arranged to take Marina and Lee up to Mobile. We left
on a Saturday around noon, and I believe Joyce was with us, and also her
two children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long were you gone on that trip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, we came back that Sunday afternoon, or, we left there
about 2 o'clock, I think it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had there been any discussion in advance about Lee giving
a lecture or anything to the boys there at that school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What's the name of that school, Mrs. Murret?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. What school is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At Mobile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Where Gene was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. The Jesuit House of Study.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Jesuit House of Study at Mobile, Ala.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, Mobile. So Gene asked us to bring Lee and Marina over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
and, you see, they allow a speaker over there at that school so many times a
year, and he said maybe Lee could speak on his experiences in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then there was a discussion in advance of Lee's going over there
about his speaking, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Only that he might speak about his experiences in Russia is
all. There wasn't anything else arranged that I know of, I don't think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this in a conversation between you and your son?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, by letter that was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. We never would get to see Gene, you see, unless we would
go over there. He wasn't supposed to call us on the phone or anything like that.
But they do allow you to visit every so often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is he allowed to call you by telephone if it's important and he
gets permission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, he's not supposed to use the phone to call home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But he may write you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, and then we visit so many times a year&mdash;I mean, we go up
there, but that's all. Now, we call him, like on holidays and things like that.
We are allowed to do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But he can't call you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, he can't call us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why is that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, they just don't like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do they like you to call up there? In other words, do they
mind if you call him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't think they like it, but, like I said, on holidays or something
we can do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that one of the rules of the school authorities over there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I guess so, because otherwise Gene would call us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, tell me about your trip over there. Just what
happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, when I saw Lee coming out of the house to get in the
car, it was a hot day, and he had this flannel shirt on, and I said, "Oh, Lee, let
me give you another shirt that won't be so uncomfortable," but he wouldn't
accept another shirt. He kept the flannel shirt on, and that's the way he went
over there. He didn't want me to get him another shirt. He just wouldn't
accept favors from anybody. He was so independent. Well, anyway, we got
over there, and that night we were going to meet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's you and your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. And Joyce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Joyce, your daughter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And her two children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Lee and Marina, and their child June?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, and Ron and Jill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Ron and Jill?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, they are Joyce's children, and Mr. Murret paid all the
expenses, including the motel rooms and the meals, and so forth. Now, when
Lee and Marina came out from freshening up, they looked real nice. I was
really surprised, especially at Marina. She had got herself all dressed up, and
she looked like a different person, and he was very attentive too to Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Always?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Always. Now, what he did at home&mdash;how he acted around
her there, I don't know, but when he was in my presence he was very attentive
to her and very well mannered. He would, I mean, open the car door for her,
and so forth&mdash;very attentive. He would pull the chair out for her and things
like that. He was very well mannered. I have to say that for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was her attitude toward him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, she seemed the same way. They seemed to get along very
nicely together, I thought, when they were here in New Orleans. They would
take a ride out the French Market and buy some crabs and some shrimp and come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
home and boil and cook them. They got a big bang out of doing things like that.</p>

<p>Now, Marina was pregnant about that time, and we asked them if we could
do anything for her in the way of getting some sort of treatment before the
birth of the baby, but Marina didn't want any treatment. She said she didn't
need any, and it seemed like Lee must have had her at Charity Hospital, I think
at least one time, because he said they told him that when she was ready to have
the child, to just come right on in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion of a rifle at any time in your presence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No discussion about anything like that by anybody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see a rifle around in the garage where this stuff was
stored?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see a package out there that looked like it might
contain a rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I never did see one around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You never saw anything that looked like a rifle or shotgun at all
among his belongings that he had put in the garage in the corner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; but I didn't really pay too much attention to all that stuff.
The only thing I remember him ever taking out of there was these boots and
this hat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you attend this lecture that Lee gave over in Mobile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, no; women couldn't attend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that on a Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. It was on a Saturday night; yes, sir, because we came back the
next afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was just for the boys from the House of Study, is that your
understanding?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right. No women were allowed, and during that time
they had one of the boys there that spoke Russian, and he never got a chance
to talk with the other boys in Russian, of course, so Gene told him that Marina
was outside that night, so he came out, and he spoke with Marina in Russian,
and so he and Marina had a very nice conversation about different things, and
we walked up to the chapel, and he showed Marina the chapel, and so forth, and
I don't know what he was saying to her, because they were both talking in
Russian. So I don't know what all they were talking about. So then after they
talked for a while, he left. Now, after the talk Lee gave at the meeting, I
asked Gene, "Well, how was it?" and he said, "Well, it was all right."</p>

<p>Previous to that time, I had said to Lee&mdash;I knew that Lee was going to talk
about being in Russia, so I said to Lee, "Maybe you had better map out some
thoughts for your talk, just what you might be going to say, so you won't be too
nervous," and he said, "Oh, don't worry about me; I give talks all the time."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He said he gave talks all the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's what he said. He said, "I'm used to that." He said, "I
give talks all the time." I asked Marina later on one day if she would like to
attend mass the next morning with me, and she said yes, she would, and she
asked Lee about it, so they were talking it over in Russian, so I don't know what
they were saying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she go with you to mass the next morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say she liked it, or what did she say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; she said, "I like your church very much."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Marina said that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I said, "Marina, I'm sorry you don't live near me; we
could go to church together," and I said to her, "I wish you would become a
Catholic."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Marina could converse to some extent in English, could she not?
She could communicate with you to some extent, couldn't she?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I could make her understand most things, you know, about
what I was talking about. Now, another thing, Lee didn't want the baby to be
baptized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who didn't?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Lee. He told me that the baby was baptized, but in the orthodox
religion, and he wanted the baby to be baptized in the Lutheran religion.
Marina wanted the baby to be baptized in the Orthodox Church, and she went
ahead and did it, and I think that's something he probably resented&mdash;not the
baptism itself but the church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had this occurred before they came to New Orleans? Had the
baby been baptized before that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I think it was in Dallas or Fort Worth. I don't know
which.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did any other incident arise that you can think of between
Marina and Lee that might help the Commission in its investigation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, his attitude was pretty bad about certain things, like
the time he asked her to pass him the catsup. He just said, "Give me that" and
she said, "Don't ask it in that manner," and he said, "Well, I'm the Commander
around here," but of course I don't think he really meant that the way it
sounded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You think that was just a passing remark, just a figure of speech?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; with no meaning. In fact, I didn't think anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you think that Lee was arrogant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I didn't think that. I think with a lot of people, it depends
on whether they like you or they don't like you, I mean, in the way they act
toward you, and with Lee, most people would dislike him because of the fact
that he was not a mixer and he did seem to be arrogant, I guess you would call
it, but he wasn't. I think it all depends on whether you like a person like that.
Me, I don't like a man who yap, yap, yaps all the time. Lee was a person who
didn't feel that he ought to say anything unless it was important. Some people
thought he had an arrogance about him, I suppose, from the way he carried himself,
the way he walked, but he just walked very straight all the time. That
was his natural walk. Some people passed remarks about Lee's mouth, the
way it looked, but that's the way his mouth was, and he couldn't help that,
and after you knew him for a while, you didn't pay any attention to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was there about his mouth that you noticed particularly?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, it sort of set back a little bit&mdash;a little different from most
people, but it really wasn't that bad. It just looked like he was holding his
mouth that way, but he really wasn't. That just the way it was, but a lot of
people didn't like him for it. Like that time he ran into this place on Magazine
and asked the man there to let him look at television, and the man right
away refused to let him, refused to let him turn on the television. He said
who did he think he was, and things like that, and he thought Lee was a little
smart aleck or something, I guess, but I took it the other way, that here's a kid
that doesn't have a television set in his house, and he doesn't have anything
to do, and he's alone, and he has come to me thinking I will be nice enough
to turn on the television for him, and so I would do it. But I guess all people
don't think alike about things like that. A lot of people take that sort of
thing the wrong way, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mrs. Murret, there are some records from Beauregard
School indicating&mdash;either Beauregard or Easton, showing that his address was
809 French Street. Now, that was your old address, before they changed the
numbering on your street, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wonder if you would tell me how that came about, Mrs. Murret?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, it came about&mdash;they only had one house in the 700
block, from Canal <span class="locked">Boulevard&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; I don't mean that. I mean, how did it come about that Lee
gave your home address as his address?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, well, they changed all the numbers in that block. We
had been in the 800 block, but they changed it to the 700 block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I understand that, Mrs. Murret, but tell me, if you will, how it
came about that Lee registered at either Beauregard School or Warren Easton
as living at your address, at 809 French Street, which was your address?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, that was brought about when he first came back from
New York with his mother, and they stayed at my house for 2 weeks, and that
was when they registered him at Beauregard, because she didn't have a place
yet, and she gave them my address. In fact, if she hadn't given them my address
and given some other address in another district, he would have had to go to
another school, and she wanted him to go to Beauregard School. It had a
good reputation as a good school, and she said she would like to have him
enrolled there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me, how did Lee act when he came in from New York with
his mother and lived at your home for those 2 weeks? What was his conduct
generally, as you recall it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, he didn't act any different than any other child, I don't
think. He was in school all day long, and he came home in the afternoon, and
just sort of hung around inside, and he would eat supper and go to bed, and
the same thing the next day. He didn't talk much. He never really did talk
unless you said something to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The same old pattern, would you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; but there are a lot of people that don't like to talk. It's
just that some people are inclined to talk a lot, and others just aren't. You
run across that every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I agree with you on that. Do you recall an occasion or a situation
in which Lee was a member of, or at least attended some activity of the
Civil Air Patrol?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know anything about that other than my sister Marguerite
told me that he was a friend of this boy at Beauregard, and that through
him he had joined the Civil Air Patrol, and he had to have a uniform and so
forth, but that's about all I know about it. They were living on Exchange Alley,
or Exchange&mdash;whatever that is, at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exchange Place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I think that's it, Exchange Place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember your son John giving Lee a white shirt and
tie on one occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; Lee was getting ready to go on this job, and John was in
the back getting dressed to go to work, I think, and he didn't think Lee looked
presentable. John is such a big boy, and he said it in such a nice way&mdash;he can
do it, you know, but he asked Lee, he said, "Lee, here's a shirt; take it; it doesn't
fit me. You put it on, and here's a nice tie to go with it." He said "Come on,
kid, you want to look good when you go for that job, you know," and so he gave
the white shirt and the tie to Lee to go after the job, and Lee took them, and
when his picture was taken for that "Fair Play for Cuba" business, he had
that same shirt and tie on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He had the same shirt and tie on that your son John had given
him when he had his picture taken on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; the same white shirt and the tie. They belonged to John,
and he had given them to Lee to go after a job. Now, John felt sorry for
Lee in a way, and he was trying to help him. John was good that way around
anybody who he felt sorry for, like one time he said, "Come on, Lee, let's go
for a ride, and I'll let you drive the car," and I think he sat next to Lee and
let Lee steer the car, or something, but I don't know anything about that. I
don't think Lee ever did know how to drive a car. Maybe he did, but as far
as I know, he didn't know how to drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I believe you said during the course of this discussion that you
thought Lee was left handed. What led you to say that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, as a child, when he was a small child, I knew he ate with
his left hand, and I always thought that he did things with his left hand. Now,
whether he used both hands or not, I don't know, but he did use his left hand
as a child. I remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In fact, children are often ambidextrous, aren't they?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They eat with either hand, don't they?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; they do. I have known of cases where children have
started out eating with their left hands, and they switch over as they grow older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
to their right hands, but then there are some children who never use their right
hand, I don't think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was an impression you had of him as a very small boy
though, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see Lee write left handed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After he reached, say, high school age?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You never noticed it one way or the other?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When he was living with you during those 2 weeks, when they
came back from New York, did you ever see him use his left hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I never noticed really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your boys are all right handed, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I remember you told me earlier today that Lee wanted to go
out and play ball, and perhaps get on some team, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you gave him, you said, a glove that belonged to one of your
boys, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, wasn't that glove for a right-handed player, if it belonged to
one of your boys, and they were all right handed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was one of your boy's gloves, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you listen to the debate over the radio between Lee and the
Cuban boy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, he called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who, Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; Lee called and said he was going to talk on the radio, so&mdash;we
were getting supper ready, because it was supposed to come on about then,
but we forgot about it until after it started, but then we turned it on and did
hear some of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You heard some of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion at any time about Lee's political
views?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Not in my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And not with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; and I don't think with any other member of my family.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever observe Lee, as far as his manual dexterity was
concerned, his coordination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I never paid too much attention to that. I know he wasn't
prepared to do anything in life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was your son John attempting to teach him to drive an automobile?
Did your son talk to you about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; he didn't say anything about that. I don't know what John
had in mind. Anyway, they went riding, but they weren't gone too long, and
then they came back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would it have been as long as a couple of hours?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; not a couple of hours; just a spin around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did John report that Lee could or could not drive? Did he say
anything either way as to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. You mean on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, we always felt that Lee didn't know how to drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As far as you know, he couldn't drive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let's see if I have your family right now, if you will bear with
me. You have a daughter, Mrs. Emile, and her given name is Joyce, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
husband's name is O'Brien, and they live at 1615 Fairway, Beaumont, Tex., is
that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have a son, Dr. Charles W. Murret, a dentist, who has an
office at 1207 West Bernard, Chalmette, La.; you have a son Gene, and that's
spelled E-u-g-e-n-e, who is studying for the priesthood, and who lives at 3959
Loyola Avenue, Mobile, Ala., is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, he has a designation of S.J. What is that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Society of Jesus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he's the boy who attended law school, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And a fine student?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He certainly was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he is unmarried?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, you can't be married and be a Jesuit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your son John lives at 6622 Louis XIV, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then your daughter Marilyn, she lives with you, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She's unmarried?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Unmarried. She says you have to want to get married to get
married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She doesn't want to get married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right. She says that's not for her. Now, Charles didn't
see Lee at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Charles is your dentist son?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But your daughter Marilyn did, and John did, and you have told
us about Gene and your daughter Joyce&mdash;they did, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And of course your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you ever in their apartment on Magazine Street, Mrs.
Murret?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Just that morning when we went there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's the morning that they arrived, Mrs. Paine and Marina&mdash;arrived
from Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Right. We took them home that night, and I was there then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Lee ever speak of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy or
Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He said one time that he thought Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy was
a very fine person, and that he admired her for going around with her husband,
and so forth, but he never spoke about that again, or never said anything
about it. In fact, I think he said he liked him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Liked President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about Lee Oswald's habits? Was he a drinking man, for
example?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I never knew of Lee to drink or smoke. In fact, when I read
about, you know, after the assassination, about finding cigarettes there in that
room, I was surprised, because I have never known of Lee to smoke. Now,
Marina said he didn't want her to smoke. She said she had learned to smoke
in Russia when other Americans had given her cigarettes, but that Lee didn't
want her to smoke at all. We see nothing wrong in smoking, except that Lee
just didn't want her to smoke. I see now where Dr. Ochsner doesn't want anybody
to smoke. My boys don't smoke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As far as you know, did Lee ever live in a rooming house around
here?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he have any communistic literature or Russian literature
that you know of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I didn't see any. All he showed me was pictures of Marina
and the baby when he first came, and some of Marina's family, but that's about
all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever hear Lee discuss anybody by name, like Jack
Ruby, or Rubenstein?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No one else ever discussed him in your presence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No. Lee only spoke when he was spoken to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Murret, is there anything that occurs to you at the end
of this long day, and I know you are tired, that I haven't brought out, either
because I don't know about it or haven't thought of it, anything that you think
might be of some assistance to the Commission in its work of investigating all
the facts and circumstances involving the assassination of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I wish I could think of something else, but I don't think
I can. I can only say this. Lee appeared to be very kind to Marina, and I
thought it was very nice of him to come up to the hospital to see me; and about
my sister Marguerite, I could only tell you what she has already told in her life
story, I guess, but I will say that I have never found her to tell an untruth.
She's a woman with a lot of character and good morals, and I'm sure that what
she was doing for her boys, she thought was the best at the time. Now, whether
it was or not is something else, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your impression of the morality of Lee Oswald during
his lifetime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. His morality, as far as I know, was very good. That's what
baffles me, being the type of boy he was, I just couldn't see how he could do
anything like that, but it's hard to judge a person that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the years that you knew him, did he ever have fits of
temper, that you thought were unusual?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, he visited with me often, and he did a lot of things that
I wondered about at the time, but there were times when I think he was just
like any other person. It was just that he was always so quiet, and he was
hard to get close to. He just wouldn't talk unless you would talk to him first,
and, like I say, he was kind to Marina. Of course now, I don't know what
went on in their home, but he always treated her like a gentleman at our house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you had no impression of him as being a violent person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; not at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, Mrs. Murret. I very much appreciate your help. This
has been a long and a hard day, and I know that you are tired. There is just
one other thing now, Mrs. Murret. You have the privilege of reading your
deposition and signing it, if you wish, but you also may waive that, in which
case the reporter will go ahead and transcribe the deposition, and it will be
sent on to Washington. If you elect to read the deposition, then we would
want to know that now, so that the U.S. attorney can call you and tell you when
it is ready to be read and signed by you. Do you have any preference, one
way or the other?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I don't think so. I will just waive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You want to waive the reading and signing of the deposition
then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right; thank you, Mrs. Murret.</p>

<p>The testimony of Marilyn Dorothea Murret was taken on April 6, 1964,
at the Old Civil Courts Building, Royal and Conti Streets, New Orleans, La.,
by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>Marilyn Dorothea Murret, a witness, having been duly sworn by Mr. Wesley J.
Liebeler to testify the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help
her God, testified as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am a member of the legal
staff of the President's Commission investigating the assassination of President
Kennedy. The Commission has authorized staff members to take the testimony
of witnesses pursuant to authority granted to it by Executive Order 11130,
dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution of Congress number 137.</p>

<p>I understand Mr. Rankin wrote you last week and told you that I would
be in touch with you concerning the taking of your testimony, and I understand
that he enclosed with his letter a copy of the Executive order to which I
have just referred, as well as the copy of the Joint Resolution of Congress, and
the rules of procedure adopted by the Commission governing the taking of
testimony of witnesses, is that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are technically entitled to 3-days' notice of this hearing
under the Commission's rules. As I understand it, the Secret Service contacted
you on Friday of last week. This may not actually be 3-days' notice, but you
have the right to waive that notice. I presume that you are willing to do so,
since you are here and willing to testify?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The general nature of the Commission's inquiry is to ascertain,
evaluate, and report upon the facts relating to the assassination of President
Kennedy and to the subsequent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. We want to
inquire of you as to any knowledge that you may have of the background of
Lee Harvey Oswald, and as to any knowledge that you may have of his activities
while he was here in New Orleans during the spring and summer of
1963.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Before we get into the details of your knowledge on those
questions, would you please state your full name for the record?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Marilyn Dorothea Murret.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. 757 French.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where were you born, Miss Murret?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you lived all of your life here in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, except for the time I traveled and I lived 2 years in St.
Louis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, would you give us a brief run-down of your educational
background?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, from elementary on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I went to John Dibert Elementary School, and John McDonogh
High School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Those are both located here in the city of New Orleans?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; and Loyola University, and L.S.U. at Baton Rouge,
and Tulane, and a summer at Duke, and University of California, the Sorbonne,
and University of Madrid, and St. Louis <span class="locked">University&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What degrees do you hold from these schools which you have
mentioned?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I just have a B.A., and the others were educational courses&mdash;instead
of going to one school, I just went to various ones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What school gave you your B.A.?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Tulane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tulane University?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I understand that you are a teacher. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you presently teaching?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Fortier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where is that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Fortier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you taught at the Junior University of New Orleans?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; unfortunately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did teach there?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. September through December, but he didn't pay us&mdash;he paid
the first check, but he is out of business at the moment, and he didn't pay the
last two. But he recently paid me for the November check, and he still owes
me for December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is the person who is running the Junior University of
New Orleans?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; it is closed down now, but he still has the one across the
river. He had two, one on this side, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Two so-called universities?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir. But the one on it St. Charles is closed, and the
one across the river is still operating.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you taught at the <span class="locked">one&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Across the river. We didn't get paid so <span class="locked">we&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If I understand, the one you taught at is still operating,
but they haven't paid you your salary, so you quit and started teaching at
Fortier?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who are your parents?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Mr. and Mrs. Charles Murret.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your father is also known as Dutz Murret?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your father's occupation?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, steamship clerk&mdash;I don't know whether it comes under
the jurisdiction of, whether it is under the Mississippi Shipping, or how they
operate, actually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know the name of the company for which he works?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know if it is just&mdash;the way it is, if there is no business
on one wharf, they call him on another. I just don't know how that works.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And your mother's name <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Lillian Murret, maiden name Claverie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your mother is the sister of Marguerite Claverie, is she <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who is the mother of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you familiar with your mother's family? Does she have
other brothers and sisters?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. They are all&mdash;most of them are dead. Her brothers all died
when they were quite young, I believe during World War I, and when her
mother died, she was about 33 years old. Her father died when I was very
young, and I don't remember him at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your mother's father died when you were a young girl?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That is right, and her mother died when she was 33.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mean <span class="locked">when&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. When her mother was 33.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When her mother was 33?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I think the eldest child is&mdash;I just don't have any idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many brothers and sisters did your mother have?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Three sisters, I think, and two brothers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And one of these sisters would have been Mrs. Oswald; is that
correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So altogether in the family there would have been four girls
and two boys?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your mother's three sisters and the <span class="locked">two&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. All of these three sisters, except for Mrs. Oswald, and both
of the two brothers are deceased, is that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. One other sister is still living, and the rest are all dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is the other sister's name?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Mancy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that her last name?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That is her first name, and I can hardly remember the last
name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know her last name?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I do, but I can't remember it. It will come to me in a moment.
She lives in Frankfort. She goes from one daughter to the other daughter
because her husband is dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So she lives <span class="locked">in&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. From Kentucky and Tennessee, from Kentucky to Tennessee
she goes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So she lives in Frankfort, Ky., and at times she goes over
to Tennessee and lives with her children? How many children does she have?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Three&mdash;no, four. That is Winfry, is her name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is the name of the other of your mother's sisters?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. It was Marguerite, Mancy, my mother, and Pearl was the other
one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Pearl, who is deceased?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Has she children living?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is Pearl's last name?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Whittaker. But he is dead also, the husband.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were her children boys or girls?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Two boys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know where they live now?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Emile Whittaker lives in Jefferson Parish somewhere, but I
don't remember the street, and Jack Whittaker, I don't know where he lives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was the second one?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That one was Jack&mdash;she had two boys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where does Jack live? Do you know, offhand?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The first boy's name was Emile?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Going back now to Mancy Winfry, you said she had four
children?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are they boys and girls?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Three girls and one boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know their names and where they are living?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Andrew Winfry is the boy, and he goes to school, but I am not
sure whether it is in Tennessee or Kentucky.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You would think in Tennessee somewhere?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; or maybe the university&mdash;might be Kentucky. I don't
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know the names of the three girls and where they live?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Anne is one, and I think that she lives in Frankfort, and Nanny,
but I don't know if that is her real name, and that probably is just a nickname,
and then Jackie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And Jackie?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where do Nanny and Jackie live? Do you know?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Either in Tennessee or Kentucky. Anne lives&mdash;I don't know,
either in Tennessee or Kentucky also. But, anyway, two of the daughters live
in the same State, and one in the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many brothers and sisters do you have?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Three brothers and one sister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Three brothers and one sister?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What are your brothers' names?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Charles, Eugene, John; and my sister is Joyce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is your sister Joyce older than you?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She is older?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As I understand it, Charles Murret is a dentist here in the city
of New Orleans? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Eugene Murret is studying at the Catholic seminary?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The seminary is in Mobile, Ala.?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. John Murret does what?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He works for the Squibbs Pharmaceutical Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Here in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is Joyce married?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is her last name?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. O'Brien.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And she lives in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; in Beaumont, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now we will have the two brothers of your mother, and their
names were what?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. One was John.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. John?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And the other?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think Charles. I didn't know them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do they have children living of which you know?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; they died when they were very young&mdash;1918 and 1919,
during World War I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. They do not have any children surviving them?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; there were none.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As I understand it, your mother's sister, Marguerite, has three
sons?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Lee Harvey Oswald, Robert Oswald, and John Pic?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What contact have you had personally with Marguerite Oswald
over the years?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, when I was younger, she and mother were always on the
outs. I remember her then, and then she would move away and come back
and occasionally she would stay with us. The last time she moved back to
New Orleans was when she lived on&mdash;she would stay 1 or 2 days or <span class="locked">so&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And this last time was when?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She had been away, and then I hadn't see her, but when she
was on Exchange Alley, I think she visited one day. But when they were
on Exchange, living on Exchange Alley, of course, I used to see her occasionally.
I mean when she would come over and visit, but then she moved to Texas, and
I hadn't seen her for ages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So then you haven't seen her since she lived here in New Orleans
on Exchange Alley, is that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember approximately when it was that she lived
on Exchange Alley?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't really remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember the address where she lived on Exchange
Alley?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any recollection of where Mrs. Oswald had been
prior to the time that she moved back to New Orleans and lived on Exchange
Alley?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think they were in Texas, but I don't think we heard from
them when she was somewhere else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any occasion to meet Lee Harvey Oswald when
you saw Marguerite, during the time that she lived on Exchange Alley?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, then he was going to Beauregard, so I would see him
occasionally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that Beauregard Junior High School?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember generally on what occasions you would meet
Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He came over to the house several times to eat, but I don't
think he was over very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. About how old was he then? Do you remember?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know&mdash;at that time I guess he would be getting out of
high school&mdash;well, then, you would be getting out of high school when you were
about 16, so he might have been around&mdash;I don't really know, because I think
he was 17 when he got in the service, and it wasn't long after that, so he might
have been about 15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Fifteen?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I did not ask you when you were born, and will you tell us?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. July 14, 1928.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form any impression of Lee Oswald during the time
that you saw him, when his mother lived on Exchange Alley?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He was just like anybody else, I guess, but he was very reserved.
He was always very reserved, and he liked to be by himself. His reason
for that was always that he didn't have the same interests with the other
children. I mean, he liked to read, and he loved nature, and he would just go
and sit out in the park and meditate, I guess. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to him about these things, or how did you learn
that he had this liking for nature and would sit in the park?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I remember it at that time, because he had gotten into a fight
with children at Beauregard; however, this is what my mother told me, and I
don't remember this, and, anyway, it seems that he was from the North, and so
they ridiculed him at the school. I don't know if it was because of the way
he was dressed or not, but I actually didn't see anything wrong with his appearance,
and so, he was riding in the streetcar one day, I believe, and he sat next
to some Negroes. Well, when he got out of the streetcar, or bus, or whatever
it was, these boys ganged up on him, and hit him in the mouth, and loosened
his front teeth, I believe. But this I only know from my mother.</p>

<p>Well, it was after that, and then another time, and I don't know if they were
teasing him and they said, "Oh, Lee&mdash;" and when he turned around, they hit
him. It was just actually that&mdash;even though he was in fights, I think that it
wasn't always his fault because I don't think he was an agitator in any way,
because he really minded his own business. That much I know, but the incidents
I only know from what my mother said. So, at that time I think he made the
statement also, that it wasn't his fault, that he was minding his own business
and "I don't have the same interests as the other students." They didn't like
him because of his accent, and because he sat next to the Negroes, which was one
incident. But he was extremely quiet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it in connection with the discussion of these various difficulties
that he had, that you learned that he used to just go to the park and sit
in the park and observe nature, and was fond of it, interested in that sort of
thing?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't think he told me that&mdash;my mother must have told me
that, because this came up when they told me this, when that boy, or that is,
when some of the students from Beauregard were on TV and said that he was
always in fights, and it was then that my mother said, actually, I mean, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
she didn't think it was his fault, because she remembered those particular
incidents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you and your mother have had discussions about this after
the assassination?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And the occasion for that discussion was that some of his
<span class="locked">former&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He might have told me that he didn't have anything in common
with the other students&mdash;I don't remember this. This was a long time ago, and
she always had said that, but I may have said that before also. I just don't
remember. I know it was this time when she told me that that was the reason
for not associating with the other students, and that they made fun of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And this discussion came up when these former students from
Beauregard came on the program, or on the air at this TV station and said that
Lee Harvey Oswald had always been involved in fights when he was a young man,
and the purport of that was that he was belligerent and difficult to get along
with, and this is something that you might expect from a fellow like that, but
your mother did not have that opinion?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. And from what I know&mdash;it is a long time ago&mdash;but he was very
quiet, and I know he didn't have many friends, I don't think, but he was not
the belligerent type. He just minded his own business, and, of course, if he
committed this act, I guess it was a perverted mind&mdash;I don't know&mdash;but he had
a certain manner about him that other children never had. I mean he was very
refined, he really was, and extremely well mannered. I mean he was not an
agitator to where you would say that any trouble started with him&mdash;I don't
know. I mean from what I know, he never was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember that Lee gave this impression back during
the days that you knew him? Do you have any firsthand knowledge of that
difference between him and the other boys as far as refinement and being well
mannered?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. As far as manners, yes. Definitely. And I mean with some
people that would irritate them&mdash;that would irritate many people, I suppose.
I don't know, but that I do remember. And, as I said, he was very quiet, so he
never talked, and it was very seldom, but he always had this manner, except
that when he was a very young child he was very&mdash;he was darling, and very
outgoing, and a very pretty child. He was adorable, and I mean if you walked
in the street with him, everybody would stop because he lived with us until he
was two, or a little over two, but if my mother took him to Canal Street, everybody
stopped to admire him. He was a very pretty child, and very happy, very
cute.</p>

<p>But, at Beauregard, I don't think there was anything different about him and
the others, other than he was not&mdash;well, other than, as I was saying, he would
have this very erect carriage at that time also, and, well, his manner was just
different from those people, or from most of those students, I should say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of any other ways in which Lee differed from
his associates or fellow students at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; at that time I don't think because&mdash;well, I think he wanted
to play ball, or other things, but he didn't have the money&mdash;it could have been
other things. I just don't know. I mean he wanted to play ball, and he didn't
have the money to buy the equipment, and this is a long time ago, I am telling
you, and I can't remember whether my brothers or somebody gave him some
equipment, and he was very appreciative, very thankful, you know. And I mean
I guess he couldn't do what the other children did, because he couldn't afford it.
I mean he was interested in sports at that time, and he did like others, but I
mean he was more reserved than the average person; but he wasn't&mdash;I guess
he was interested in some of the same things like that, but I mean he wasn't a
giddy child, is what I mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned this television program in which these former
fellow students of his at Beauregard indicated that he had been involved in
fights when he was at Beauregard. Do you remember what station that program
was on?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. WDSU, I think, and the characters came on over and photographed
my house and went all over the neighborhood, asking the neighbors
what type of people we were, and what type of person my mother was. And,
of course, my mother is a real good woman, so everybody had something nice to
say. But it could just have been the other way around. It was absurd, and they
pulled everything out, all that the people had said, and they quoted it. It was
very, you <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember the name of any of the students?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Voebel, Ed Voebel, and he wears glasses, and I think he said that
he was friendly with Lee at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of any others?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Any other people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; that were on the television program?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, other groups of students, some girls, and a group of girls
said that he was belligerent, you know, or that they didn't like the way he
dressed, and all this nonsense. But he was the only one who spoke in any detail,
and I think he was the only one who was very friendly and got him to
join the Civil Air Patrol, in which he was very interested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was this just a news program, or was it a feature program run
by a particular reporter or commentator?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. A reporter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Probably just a reporter had called these people in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you don't remember the names of any of the men at WDSU
that might be familiar with this that were on the program when these people
were interviewed by someone, presumably?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. My mother knows the names of the men, or the man, I believe,
because he wrote this letter and wanted some detailed information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The reporter talked to you personally?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. The first time my father talked, and they get you off guard, of
course, and I don't know what he told them. They asked him if he had stayed
at my house, and my father at that time stated that he had, and that was all he
said, and after that they came in and they wanted to take pictures and everything
else. I asked them to leave, which they did, but for days after they were always
coming around, and, of course, we had no comments. The one from WDSU got
very irate, so he went up and down the block and interviewed the entire neighborhood,
and it was about a half an hour show, around 7 o'clock or so, and had all
the comments by the neighbors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did any of the neighbors remember Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. The girl next door probably did because he had stayed there a
few days when he came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He stayed at your house a few days? This was in 1963?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned that Lee had stayed with you when he was a
young boy until the time that he was about 2 years old. You were about 11 or 12
years old at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Just about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any recollection of Lee as a young child other than
what you have already indicated to us that he was a very pretty child, and that
he was <span class="locked">adorable&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He was adorable, and his personality, he was just&mdash;well, he was
very bright, you know, very observant, and he was just a darling child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And he gave no indication of any behavior problems?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; he was darling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There wasn't anything apparently wrong with him at all?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. And very pleasant, you know, not the type of child who if he
didn't get his way would start screaming&mdash;never any of that. He was just a very
pleasant child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What were the circumstances that led to Lee's living with you
at that time? Do you know?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I think the mother had to work and we kept him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. His father had died shortly, or, actually before he was born?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember where Lee's mother worked during that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know&mdash;she worked for several department stores, and in
a hosiery shop that she was managing, and I don't know if it was Jean's Hosiery
Shop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So it was hosiery shops or department stores?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, then Lee left your house. Where did he go after that?
Do you know?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think that is when he went to Texas. I am not sure if that is
when she married Ekdahl, or if she married Ekdahl later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Or what?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, she married Ekdahl when he was very young.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When Lee was very young?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recall whether or not Lee was ever in an orphanage, an
orphan home here in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I know the other two boys were, and we were trying to figure
out whether he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you are not sure whether he ever was or not?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I am not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But up until the time that Lee left you and went back either to
his mother or to Texas, or wherever he went, your recollection is perfectly clear
that Lee was a normal, happy, bright young boy? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned this man Ekdahl, and can you tell us the background
on that, and you were probably around 13, 12 or 13 years old, or perhaps
even a little older, when Mrs. Oswald married Mr. Ekdahl; is that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember ever having met Mr. Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I met him once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know the correct spelling of his name?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What were the circumstances surrounding the meeting with
Mr. Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. My circumstances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. No; the circumstances?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He just stopped over there one day, and I think he and my aunt
had John Edward and Robert with him, and they were going to military school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was this after they were married?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. It might have been before&mdash;I don't know whether she got
married here, or she met him in Texas. I don't really know that. I do know
that I saw him on one occasion, and at the time she had the two boys&mdash;he had
the two boys with him, John and Robert, because, if I remember, they were
in uniform. I met him on the one occasion, and if I can remember, they had
the two boys with them, and they were both in uniform.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear of the circumstances under which Mrs.
Oswald married Ekdahl, or met him? What do you know about this relationship?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Just nothing other than what my mother has said, that actually
she didn't want to get married because he was an older man, and I think he
was sick, or something, and it was his sister who said, "Well, why don't you
marry him?" So, they got married. I think she was quite hesitant about it,
actually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Before Mrs. Oswald married Lee Harvey Oswald's father, she
was married to a man named Pic, is that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you ever met him?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know anything about that marriage?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, that again, only from what my mother has said, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
he did not want any children, and father and she found that very difficult to
believe, so they thought that maybe it was just Marguerite saying that. And
she loved him, and then when she got pregnant, or, she got pregnant once and
lost the baby, and he had threatened to leave if she got pregnant.</p>

<p>So, after she lost the baby, he wanted her to go back to him, which she did.
But when she got pregnant with John, he didn't&mdash;he said that he would leave
before that, if she got pregnant, or something, so, anyway, he talked to my
mother and my mother found out definitely that that was true. And he definitely
did not want any children.</p>

<p>So when she got pregnant with John, she left because he didn't want her to
have the baby, or he didn't want her to ever to get pregnant, so she left, or he
left. He left her, or she left him&mdash;it might be the other way, but, anyway, he
didn't want any children, and he had always threatened that if she got pregnant,
he would leave. But I think that when she got pregnant with John, she was
probably carrying him, so she left, or maybe he said he was leaving&mdash;I just
don't know. Anyway, that was mostly what my mother said, she couldn't
conceive of any man being like that, but it was definitely true, because either
she had talked to him <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Either your mother talked to Pic, or, in any event, your mother
learned that apparently it was true that Mr. Pic didn't want to have any
children?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether Mrs. Oswald, that is, Marguerite, met
Mr. Oswald before she was divorced from Pic or separated from Pic, or afterwards?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Mr. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. It was a long time after that they were married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever meet or know Lee Harvey Oswald's father?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any recollection of him, what he was like?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; just as a person, you know, and I saw a picture later, and
I could visualize him perfectly. I was very young then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any other recollections of Lee Oswald as a young
man that you can recall that you think would be helpful at this time, specifically
after he left your home at the age of two? Was the next time you saw him
when he moved back and moved over into Exchange Alley?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he seem to be the kind of person then that you would
have expected him to be, based on your recollection of him as a 2-year old? Or
did he seem different? Just tell us what impression did you have when you
met him again?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't think I really compared him to the time when he was
a child, but he was a little different, as I said, from other children in that he
was more reserved than the average teenager.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think that he was a sensitive person?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No. What I actually thought was that he, I mean he just had
certain interests and I mean because he had been reared like that, and probably&mdash;I
think is what my mother said, and I don't know, but my aunt had no
alternative&mdash;I mean they probably did the wrong thing by having him stay by
himself, but, in other words, under the circumstances they thought that that
would be better than getting into trouble with other people, and maybe it just
worked the other way around. But she trained him to be by himself, because
she had to work, and so she thought it would be better to have him stay home
and listen to the radio and television and read, rather than to get in with other
boys and do things they shouldn't do, with no intention of&mdash;I am saying if he
did this&mdash;of warping his mind. But it just happened to turn out that way, but
she thought she was doing the right thing, and he would never talk to any
strangers, or anything. He was just reared like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The last time you saw Marguerite, I think you testified this
was during the time that she lived here in New Orleans on Exchange Alley,
before she went to Texas?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form an impression of her?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Who? Marguerite?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. When she came back you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; at any time, just what your general impression and feeling
about Marguerite Oswald was?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think she is a woman of very good character, but she had a
very curt tongue, and she doesn't forget very easily. I mean if you have an
argument with her, I don't think she forgets it immediately. But she also, I
guess, and it is probably her reason for that, and I mean, if she worked, she
had to work in these department stores, and she was not a gossipy type of
woman, and I don't know but I worked a few summers in a department store,
and I know that for these sales how they&mdash;I mean they will slit one another's
throats.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The sales clerks?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. I think that the employees were arguing&mdash;she didn't
engage in petty gossip as other employees and probably got in arguments over
that, you know, and she was a little quick-tongued.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But other than that you have <span class="locked">no&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Other than that she was nice in her own way, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There was a time in the spring of 1963 when Lee Oswald came
to New Orleans, isn't that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us what you know about that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. When he came in the last time, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes. That was the next time that you saw Lee Oswald after
he and his mother left the Exchange Alley address and went to Texas, isn't
that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us what happened in connection with his coming to New
Orleans?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He telephoned my mother, I think from the bus station. Of
course, we didn't even know that he was back, and so he asked if he could stay
there a while until he got a job, and he told my mother that he was married, and
that he had a baby.</p>

<p>So, my mother asked him if he was alone, because if he had a family she
wouldn't have been able to accommodate him. But he was by himself, so she
said O.K. He stayed there a while until he found a place on Magazine Street.
And then the wife and this lady from Texas came down, and they moved into
the place on Magazine Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you live with your mother?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you at home during the time that Oswald lived there
during that period?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long was he there?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I am not sure whether it was a week or a little over a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any conversations with him during that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. During the day he was usually looking for a job, and I was
working. And in the evening maybe we would talk a little, but nothing in
particular. I was usually working on lesson plans, and he went to work about
8:30 or 9 o'clock, and the only discussions that I really had was on religion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that during this week?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that at the time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he say about that, and what did you say?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He just listened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. And then he just said or I assumed that he was an atheist
because a brother of mine is in the seminary, you <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Anyway, he knew of your brother in the seminary?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Actually, he was more concerned about that, I guess, and so
I just said this, this religious discussion. I just set this off because he was not
interested at all, and so he just listened and he said that he had his own philosophy,
and that he was an atheist. But he didn't argue, or anything, and he
just let me rave on for about an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are a Catholic, is that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. A practicing Catholic?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you expressed that to Oswald?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As best as you can recall, all he did was listen and then he
indicated that he had his own way?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Which he didn't express.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But he did tell you that he was an atheist?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He didn't go into any further details than that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you get any feeling about him when you had this discussion
with him? I mean, did it seem kind of strange to you that someone
would just sit and let you go on at such length on a subject like that, and then
not really respond to it?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That was typical of Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Typical of Lee?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He didn't express any disgust or short temperedness with you
over <span class="locked">your&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any other discussions or confrontations that
you might have had?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That was the only time that I had had any chance to talk with
him, and that was the first day that he came&mdash;I believe it was. After that,
on Saturdays, or that particular Saturday he was out all day looking around
for a job. And then on that Sunday he wanted to know where his father
was buried, and he wanted to locate some of his relatives, because he had said
that when Marina's family had asked him about his family, he didn't know
anything at all, he didn't know what descent he was, and he said he realized,
or he missed not being close to his relatives, because he didn't know any of
them other than us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ask you about this <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. My mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you were there at the time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did your mother tell him?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. My mother checked the telephone directory, and I think most
of the Oswalds were dead. Harvey Oswald, who was his godfather, I believe,
is dead. He did find one relative and he went to see her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was her name?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know, but that might have been his wife. My mother
would know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Whose wife? Harvey Oswald's?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. They were very old. That was his father's brother, but they
are all dead. But it might be one of the wives who is still living, and he
went out there to see her, and she gave him a picture of his father. And then
he went to visit the grave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Of his father?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he talk to you about that at all?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What happened to the picture? Do you know?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think he might have told my mother about it, and I think he
might have told me, but I was there that Sunday and he caught the bus and
went to the other house, and this old lady gave him the picture of his father.
And he just showed it, and that was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it a large picture <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And did he take it with him when he left, when he moved over
to the apartment on Magazine Street?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. I guess <span class="locked">so&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You haven't seen it around the house since?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned something about when he caught the bus and
went to the other aunt?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. You say to the aunt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To this aunt who gave him the picture?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I mean he left and I know he caught the bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he seem concerned about his ability to find a job?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He wanted to find a job so Marina could come down here. I
know he was looking&mdash;I mean he seemed like he really wanted to find one.
And when he found it, he seemed to be very happy about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I mean the one at the Reily Coffee Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you why he came to New Orleans to look for a job?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He had said that Marina wanted to be near the sea, and she
thought she would like New Orleans. He didn't tell me that; he told my
mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You knew at this time that he had been to the Soviet Union,
did you not?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to him about his experiences in Russia?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I asked him how he liked it, and he showed me a few photographs,
my mother and I, of where he lived. And that is when he said about
the family, that people were very family <span class="locked">conscious&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Russia?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I don't know&mdash;I think he was citing one experience
where he was traveling, or something, and there were some people who had less
than he had, and invited him in, which they would probably do here, but just
never had occasion to, and they had very little, but what they had they shared
with him. That is when he said that he was very embarrassed because when
they asked him what descent he was, he said he didn't know, didn't know nothing
at all about his family, and that is why he was determined to locate his various
relatives here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ask him why he went to Russia in the first place?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I was away when he left, and I didn't even know he left
actually, and my mother didn't tell me anything, to worry me, and I saw his
brother, John. And my sister had written me a letter just before that and said
that Marguerite had not heard from Lee, and that she had sent some money and
the envelope was returned. I didn't know where he had gone, and I guess they
just assumed that I knew. My mother didn't want to worry me probably, because
all the scandal was brewing in all the papers, and everything. I went to
visit John, and his wife told me at that <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where was John living at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. In Japan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were in Japan at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What were you doing in Japan?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I taught school over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In an English speaking school?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did John tell you that Lee had gone to Russia?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He didn't tell me&mdash;his wife told me. So I didn't bring the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
up at all with John. I mean we weren't invading anybody's privacy at all,
and if he wanted to say something, he would say. And I know that she said that
they were very upset because this put him over the barrel, and he has a family,
and he was very embarrassed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. John was?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Of course, and they had three children, and I mean it was in
Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. John was in the Air Force at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't bring the subject up of Lee at all as to why he went?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate anything about his experiences in Russia other
than what you have already told us?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. The only thing he said was&mdash;I just didn't know any of this
would happen, and I didn't know he would be leaving and I thought that he
would say what he wanted to say, because I don't believe in bombarding somebody
with questions, I really don't, and what they want to say, they say, and
what they don't want to say, they don't say. So, anyway, he said that he had
better quarters than the average person because he was an American, and they
wanted to create a good impression on him. Other than about the family and
showing me a few photographs, that is all he said. And he said that he had met
Marina at this dance, and he worked in the factory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you what kind of factory?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you what he did?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you how much he was paid?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; maybe he did, but I wouldn't know what it was, anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you about any travels that he had in the Soviet
Union?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, just that he said, and I don't know where he was going or
where he was when he said it, that these people let him spend the night there
and that they had less than he had. So if that was on the outskirts, or where
it was, I don't really know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you speak Russian?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you speak any foreign language?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I studied French and Spanish, but was hopeless.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you about any school that he might have gone to
when he was in Russia, any training that he might have gotten?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No sir; he didn't say anything at all about any kind of training.
When he first came out, I couldn't understand how he had gotten out, in the
first place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How he had gotten out of Russia to come back, you mean?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. With a Russian wife, and he did say her father was&mdash;was he a
Russian officer? <span class="locked">Anyway&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he say her <span class="locked">father&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He was, or she might have said that in her broken English, so
I couldn't conceive of how they had gotten out of Russia, and how he had access
to Russia, I mean to work there, et cetera, and then just to be allowed to leave,
with a Russian wife, and her father being in the Army. And I think that she
had an uncle&mdash;I don't know&mdash;but I think it was in the papers, or in some magazine
recently that he is with the Intelligence Service in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Her uncle?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; he, supposedly, was the one who helped him to get out.
So, that I couldn't figure out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ask him about it? Did you ask Lee about that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; and he said he'd had a tough time. That is about the
only thing I did ask him, and he said he'd had a very difficult time getting out,
and he had to wait for a particular length of time until everything went
through, and he knew that since, or if he had not had a wife, he could have
gotten out sooner, but he had to wait on her papers, and by that time they'd had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
a baby, but, anyway, I wasn't satisfied, but by that time I couldn't understand
how they got out. But, I said, well, if they let them out, they went through
the Embassy obviously, and if they were doing things he was not supposed to
do, they would be trailing him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You thought this?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, any time anybody comes out of Russia, you think it,
naturally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you didn't say anything to Lee about it?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; definitely not. I had just asked him if it was difficult
to get out, and so then I said, well, if he were up to anything, you know, they
would obviously be trailing him, so we could just forget about that because
he might really have realized that he made a mistake, and he was coming back
over here. I mean, you don't try to antagonize him&mdash;I mean you try to help
him, and figure, thinking that if he realizes that he made a mistake and he
wanted to come back here, you would do everything you could to help him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate that he had been given trouble about getting
out of Russia by the Russians or by the Americans? Or did he distinguish
between them because he thought he had been harrassed by the two authorities?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't think he really said, but I don't remember that he&mdash;I
think, or I thought he meant the Russians, because the Americans gave him
the money, evidently they were willing to give it to him anytime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you learn about the fact that the Americans had
given him the money? Did he tell you that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He told my mother that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember any more about it than just that he had
received money from the United States? Did he tell you any more details, or
did your mother repeat them to you?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, and then I read something about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After the assassination?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I think it was in Life, that he had renounced his citizenship,
but that the American Embassy said that he didn't, and that that was
why he got back here; or that if he had renounced it, he couldn't have gotten
back, so he was an alien. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know about this at all, or have any conversation with
Lee about it before the assassination?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. About what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. About this time that he renounced his citizenship and these
difficulties?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, they had articles in the papers that my mother showed
me after I came home, Fort Worth papers, that he threw the passport on the
desk. But I didn't ask him about that at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And he didn't tell you anything about it?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it seem extraordinary to you that he had been able to
obtain money from the State Department or whomever he obtained it from to
return to the United States?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Extraordinary in the fact that I didn't know how he could get
out with a Russian wife and baby, whose uncle was in the military, and an
uncle&mdash;I don't know what he was at the time&mdash;but I thought he was affiliated
with the military, but I have read something since then that the father was with
the intelligence service. But then I didn't really think too much that&mdash;well, your
first reaction, but then you don't think too much about that after because he
had to go through the Embassy. So you figure that it was one of two things,
he either really realized that he wanted to live here again, or they let him
out for a purpose. And if they did, then they would certainly be trailing him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it occur to you that he might be an agent of the Soviet
Union?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. At first; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mean when you <span class="locked">first&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. The first reaction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mean when you <span class="locked">first&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, the fact that he got out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But when you say "at first," you don't mean at first, after
the assassination? You mean at first, after you saw him?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. After he came out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you didn't really think about that too much until he came
here in 1963, or had you considered it prior to that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. We didn't know he was out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Until he came here?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't know he was back from Russia at all?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He just telephoned mother and my mother said, "I didn't even
know you were back." And he said, "I have been back for&mdash;I don't know&mdash;probably
a year."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any discussions with your mother or anybody
else in your family about the possibility that Oswald might be a Russian agent?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. As I said, I dispelled that immediately because I thought, well, if
he was, they would certainly be trailing him. So, I mean you can't go around
with suspicion like that, or, I mean certainly the American Embassy should
know what is going on. So, if that were the case, well, they would be on
his trail. And, if not, well, he was definitely sincere. I mean, you don't try to
antagonize or constantly throw up past mistakes, in case he, you <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you considered the question briefly and dismissed it for
the reasons you state?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; but just the first reaction would be, how did he get out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And, as you have stated, the reason for your thinking of the
question in the first place was because of the apparent ease with which he
was able to leave the Soviet Union with a Russian wife?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it cause you any concern to associate with him or have
anything to do with him at all after you considered the question that he might
have been a Russian agent? I mean, you said that you dismissed it because
you assumed if he was, he was being trailed, or the authorities would be in
touch with him, but did it concern you that they might associate you with
Oswald, or identify you in any way?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It did not?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After the first week that Lee was at your home, he rented an
apartment and moved out? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you there when he left your house?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you he found an apartment?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He told me about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he or did he not tell you personally?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't remember whether I was there or not. Yes; I think
I might have been. Yes; I was, because I think he came home and said that
it was a lovely place, but he didn't know whether Marina would like it,
because it had high ceilings, and she didn't like high ceilings. But he liked it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina come out to your house at this time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, when they came in, the lady from Texas brought <span class="locked">her&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In a station wagon?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know her name?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I know now; yes. It was Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know her at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; he introduced me, I think, or she introduced herself&mdash;I don't
remember&mdash;because I was getting ready to go out and that was when I was in
and out, getting dressed. But he also had referred to her just as Marina's
friend in Texas, and I told her it was very nice to meet her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. They actually came there to your house before Lee moved out,
or after he moved out?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He had moved out, I think, he himself, and then he came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
my house, and then from there they were going to go, so they wouldn't get lost&mdash;so
they could find the directions, or something. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So Marina and Mrs. Paine came to your house and they went
from there, went to the apartment on Magazine then?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. They stayed there a very short while and Marina was <span class="locked">petrified&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was she petrified about?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, on meeting us for the first time, and the language barrier,
and the baby was cross and crying because of all the people there, I guess,
and probably tired. I think Marina was nervous or probably thinking that
we would think that it was a bad or a spoiled child. So they left very shortly
after, and I don't think Marina ever came in the back. Mrs. Paine came in the
back to get a root beer, and I can't remember if that is when she introduced
herself, or I was in the front when they introduced them, or not. I met Marina
when she came into the living room. I don't remember whether he introduced
me to Mrs. Paine formally, or whether she introduced herself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was Lee there at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; he had moved <span class="locked">out&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But he had come out, that is, come back to your house to meet
Marina and Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to Marina?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She doesn't speak English. On that day we hardly said
anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It was indicated to you that she could not speak English; is
that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever try to talk to Marina in English?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did it go?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. It was exasperating.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she understand any English?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think she understood more than she could speak, but still
there is a lot she doesn't understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have the feeling that she was not very proficient in
the English language?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you able to communicate anything in any way with her
at all in English?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Just petty things, you know, like if she would eat something,
how to make that, and "no like," or through mannerisms and small words to
say a few things. She also commented, you know, when they would eat over
there a few times&mdash;on the food, but other than that, <span class="locked">she&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form any impression of Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Mrs. Paine? I don't know&mdash;my mother had said that Lee had
been invited to this professor's house, or something, to show slides, a professor
out at Tulane, a professor of languages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is his name? Is it Riseman?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That was when he was living on Magazine, and I think they
telephoned my mother to find out if anybody had called the house for an application,
or different things, and I think he said he was going that night, that
they were suppose to show slides. Now, this man had one daughter, I think,
who was in Russia, and he was a friend of Mrs. Paine's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would the name Kloepfer sound like <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How about Riseman?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't know the language professor's name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You think your mother would remember?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't think so, because I think it was the other Secret Service
man who tried to get her to remember and she couldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And this professor, he was a professor of what?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Languages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What language? Russian?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know if it was only Russian, or what, or some other
language. He just teaches, you <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you don't have any idea where he lived?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Who? The professor? No. So then it was just that he had
a daughter in Russia, and I was just wondering why she got to know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I often wonder how it was that she spoke Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who? Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; and then it came out in the paper, or it was in Time magazine,
or something, that she was a Quaker, so I discarded all those ideas also,
claiming where she was, I guess, just purely interested in the language, and
you would see people who spoke that language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you suspicious of Mrs. Paine? Were you suspicious of
Mrs. Paine in any way?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. At first, because she sought all of the Russian speaking people,
and she spoke Russian herself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you indicate that the Secret Service had discussed this
with you about the professor?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; my mother told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your mother told this to the Secret Service man?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you there when she talked to the Secret Service man?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember anything else about this professor that we
could use to find out who he was, or who he is?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't. But it probably would be easy enough to find, if
he has a daughter who is a student over there, and I don't think that that
would be too difficult to find.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After he and Marina had moved into the apartment on Magazine
Street, did you ever go to the apartment?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I just drove him over there once or&mdash;I think we drove him
home once or twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you ever inside of the apartment?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Once I went in the back part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What kind of place was it?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, they had a back part of the house, and I never did know
whether it was a double, or what, or just the back part was arranged to make
an apartment. But he had called one Sunday afternoon and said that Marina
wanted to come over there. So I think we picked them up in the afternoon
and brought them, but usually if they came, they took the bus, and we always
took them home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many times did you see the Oswalds after that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. On Magazine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That you recall? Yes?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think they came over one day, one Saturday, and then a half
a day on Sunday, or this might have been the same day&mdash;I don't know&mdash;and
Labor Day, because I was not here from the beginning of July until September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Am I correct in understanding then that the last time you saw
Oswald was on Labor Day, 1963, which would have been early in September?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that the time that you went crabbing with him?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was the occasion that you met him on Labor Day? What
did you do?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. They called up, or Lee called up and said that Marina wanted
to come over, that she was tired of sitting at home. But my mother had said,
because the last time that they were there and they were there all day, with
the language barrier, my mother was exhausted, so she told him to come in the
afternoon. And this they did, about 3 or 4 they came over in the bus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did they come over on the bus?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; and then we took them back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you go crabbing with him? You did, did you not?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think it was on a Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So this would have been before July, is that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Because you have indicated that you were not in New Orleans
during July or August of 1963?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who also went on this crabbing expedition?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Just Marina and I and he. I think the baby stayed at my
house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us what you can recall about that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. We went to the lake, and Lee was doing all the crabbing, of
course, and we didn't have any crabs, so I just sat there with Marina. And
then we walked over to the coke machine and got a coke, and I got some cigarettes,
and I remember she said that she didn't smoke, and that Lee didn't want
her to smoke. So we came on back and Marina told him something in Russian,
and he started to laugh. And he said, "Do you know what she said?" I
said "No." He said, or he was saying that women are all alike, because she was
telling him that here you spend or you only could afford, I think he had two
nets, and that was all that he had money for, and the meat, so she was telling
him, "You spend the money for the nets and the meat, and you are spending
all of your time catching nothing, when we could have gone down to the
French Market and got them for the same price." He said, "They are all alike,
you know, Russians, American, typical woman." I just sat there with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever catch any crabs that day?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember anything else that was said or that happened
on that day that was worthy of any note?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She didn't say anything and he was walking up and <span class="locked">down&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Lee was?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. And I was sitting on the steps with them, and it was only an
hour and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you were not able to talk to Marina?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I said a little bit, but nothing&mdash;I mean, you couldn't really
talk, and you would just exhaust yourself with petty things, you know, word
for word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did this crabbing expedition come to pass in the first place?
Did Lee call you and ask you to take him, <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I think that they were over there and he just said, I
don't know, maybe just that they were going to the lake. I don't remember.
And then they asked me, stopped and asked me if I wanted <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But when this started out, Lee and Marina were over at
your house on French? And Marina and Lee left from there and went on this
expedition?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form an impression as to how Marina and Lee got along
with each other?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, as I am saying, at first, I had no idea, when he first
came out, but then after I met them together, and then since the assassination,
of course, you know, how most of my thoughts are running back because
that happened, but after that time, I am saying that some statements came out
that he was very strict with her&mdash;I don't know. You don't know in anybody
else's house, I guess, but from all indications they were perfectly happy. He
was very devoted to Marina. He seemed to love his child very much. And as I
say, I am saying that he was very well-mannered, he really was. And I mean if
any other girl sat down, he pulled the chair out, and the car door was opened
to let her in and out, and he does that for everybody. And, I don't know,
she just seemed to be perfectly happy, and that is when I really thought that
my imagination had just run away with me in the beginning, and that probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
I&mdash;and he seemed to&mdash;I don't know, but they just seemed to be very family
conscious and devoted. In fact, they were a real cute couple.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There wasn't anything about that that struck you as peculiar or
out of the ordinary?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never heard of them having any marital difficulties of
any kind while they were here?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Only what I read.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Only what you read in the paper after the assassination?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When Marina mentioned to you that Lee didn't want her to
smoke, did you detect any resentment on Marina's part over that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; not at all. It was just that a lot of husbands don't want
their wives to smoke, for that matter. I mean you can't&mdash;I couldn't really type
her either, with the language barrier, but I mean she seemed to be very nice
to older people. She also, when they did eat there, she immediately went to
do the dishes, you know. You know, "Don't, Marina, I won't let you do anything
like that," and when my mother was around, she always saw that she had a
seat. And, I mean, she didn't seem to feel any resentment at all, although
she said that she had smoked before that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she indicate that she was satisfied with the apartment
<span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She didn't like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She didn't like the apartment?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She said she, "No like. No like."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you <span class="locked">understand&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, she didn't like the high ceilings, and Lee had said that
he didn't think she would, if they had a high ceiling place. In fact, when they
went, she didn't like it. She said that she liked low ceilings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you said that you were in the apartment on one occasion,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it an appealing place, or was it decently furnished?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. My mother and I had gone there, and I thought it was very
nice for the money, actually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know how much he was paying for it?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Sixty-five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What kind of neighborhood was it in?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. On Magazine&mdash;I don't know about Magazine, but I don't think
Magazine is too good. But the apartment was all newly furnished. They had
a new icebox, I believe, and the other furniture was all refinished, and the
walls newly painted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned before that you had discussed religion with
Lee; and had you ever discussed politics with him at all?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He never mentioned anything of any political significance at all,
never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Never said anything about President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Or Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; but I can't remember whether it was&mdash;if that was before
or if it was on that program, where he said something complimentary about
Kennedy, but he never mentioned anyone else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What program are you referring to?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That might have been when they showed when he was interviewed
after the Fair Play for Cuba, because it was after the assassination that
they reran that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was a television program?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you say that you saw it after the assassination?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you don't recall, but you think the man said something
complimentary about Kennedy on that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And other than that you never heard him speak of President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever talk about Civil Rights, and particularly the
Negro?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned when he was younger that he made it a point,
or at least, he did sit down on the streetcar right next to some Negroes, and
he got in trouble with his friends over that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any idea what motivated that, or whether it was
just a rebellious kind of thing?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't think he knew any better. He didn't know the cars were
segregated, I don't think. I don't know. I just remember my mother telling
me whether or not he knew, or whether he did it, you know, defiantly&mdash;I don't
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned you were not in New Orleans during July and
August of 1963, and where were you?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I went to Mexico and all through Central America and Panama.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you travel by yourself?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did you travel?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. By bus and station wagon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your own station wagon?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; public transportation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know that Oswald went to Mexico in September?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you read about that in the newspapers after the assassination?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But prior to that time you didn't know that he either planned
to go to Mexico or he was going to Mexico, or had gone to Mexico, or was even
thinking about going to Mexico?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you meet anybody on this trip to Mexico that had any connection
with, as far as you know, Lee Oswald, either at that time or subsequently?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. On this trip, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was the nature of the trip? Was it just basically a
tourist operation?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Basically a tourist operation, you say?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you returned from Mexico to New Orleans, you learned,
did you not, that Oswald had managed to get himself in jail during the summer?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did you learn that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. My family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your family told you?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did they tell you?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, just, in other words, he had the Fair Play for Cuba
pamphlets, and they took him to jail. And my sister had to go and get him
out. And, of course, she didn't know what he was in there for, and so my
mother was in the hospital at the time and my mother was not supposed to
have that operation until the fall, you know, but then they decided to have it
then. So, anyway, she was in the hospital for that, and I think she said that
Lee came up to see her&mdash;but I don't know if it was after, the next day, or
before she was operated on&mdash;came to see her at the hospital&mdash;and then that
must have been the date when he left and was distributing the pamphlets.</p>

<p>So he called up and he told Joyce that he was in jail, and to come and get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
him out. She didn't know what to do because she had her two children there,
and my mother was in the hospital, and nobody to take care of the children.
So she said, "Call me back, or something" or she said that she didn't have the
money on her, and that my mother wasn't there. Well, I don't know how
that works, but anyway, she went down to the police station and went back
home again and went up to see my mother and asked my mother what to do.
So, anyway, she went back to the station, and she said, "Before I get him
out of there, I want you to tell me what he is in there for." So the policeman
told her, he said, not to get excited because, "I've handled these cases before,
and it is not as bad as it seems," and all that. And she didn't know whether
to get him out or not, since he was involved in that. And I don't know if
they went back to the hospital or what, but they called this friend and he had
him paroled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who was the friend? Do you know?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Of course, he didn't know&mdash;that was Emile Bruneau, who is a
very prominent man. He didn't know Lee at all, and that was just a personal
favor. He is very active in the city, I mean, and this was just a personal
favor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any conversations with Lee about this episode
when you saw him on Labor Day?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I didn't ask ask him anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever see Lee drive an automobile?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. As far as I know, he didn't drive, and my brother took him
one day out through the park to attempt to teach him for about an hour. But
he had to turn down several jobs because he didn't drive. And whether he is
able to drive after one lesson like that, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As far as you know, did your brother ever let Lee take his car
and go by himself.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was your brother John?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever tell you how well Oswald did?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, it was a hydramatic and he could just steer it, and
that was about all, and with subsequent lessons he would have been able to
drive. But I doubt, and I don't think there was any traffic&mdash;I think it was in
the park.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see Mrs. Paine again when she came to pick up Marina
and take her back to Texas?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I only saw her once, and that was for about 10 or 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that was in May 1963?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know Lee had lost his job with the Reily Coffee Co.
sometime during the summer?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I guess he did&mdash;I don't know if that was after I came back
or before, when he lost it. I don't know when he lost it. When did he lose it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He lost it in July, sometime, while you were gone.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, 2 weeks at my sister's about July 1, and from there, 13
days, because the 14th is my birthday, I left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You learned that he had lost it when you got back to New
Orleans? When you got back to New Orleans, you knew that he had lost the job
and was unemployed?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was he looking around for another job? Do you know?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know. I only saw them once after that, and that was
Labor Day. I didn't ask him anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned this trip that you had been on, and you mentioned
that you were in Japan?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long were you out of the United States, and where did
you go, and what did you do?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Three and a half years, and I started out on my way and
went to Hong Kong, the Philippines, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
which was not a part of Malaysia at the time, Malaya, and straight on
around, just following the bottom&mdash;I went all through, Beirut, the Holy Land,
Egypt, Cyprus, and all through Europe and back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you work during the time you were gone on this trip?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I worked in Australia and New Zealand and Japan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As a teacher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. As a teacher; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you teach in Australian schools <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any trouble with the teacher certification problems,
or don't they have that problem in those places?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, it depends what your field is. I was teaching science,
which is the same&mdash;they have a teacher's college which is 2 years, and, if anything,
you would have more than they have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are a science teacher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where were you when you heard about the assassination?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. At Juno.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In school?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you hear that Lee had been arrested in connection
with it?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. After I came home one evening, because when I heard it, I
was eating lunch, and a little boy in my class came over and told me that he
had been shot. So they all had their radios on, and I ran over back to the class,
and I listened to it. And I remember the first part, where they said that there
was a lady and a man, and they said that they had somebody else, 30 years old,
and I didn't even hear at that time anything of having Lee at all, until I got
back home. I think that was because I had left school about 3:30, or maybe a
little earlier, and up until that time I don't think they had had something about
Lee because it was only a lady and a man, and some other man that they thought
was a foreigner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you surprised when you heard that Lee had been arrested
in connection with the assassination?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Slightly!</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In fact, you were very surprised?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you believe that he could have done it?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you didn't believe he could have done it, based on your
knowledge of him and your association with him?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you didn't think that he was motivated to do a thing like
that, or capable of it, either one?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you have been thinking about it, I am sure, since this assassination,
and searching your mind for any possible motive that Oswald
might have had for doing this, assuming that he did do it, have you not?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you come up with anything?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, so many theories have been expounded, if he did, and
I don't really know why, but I don't think, as some people said, because he was
jealous of Kennedy and all that Kennedy stood for. I don't think it would have
been that. I don't know what he would gain by killing the President when
somebody else could take over the Government just as effectively&mdash;I mean with
our governmental system. So, if he did it, it would&mdash;I don't know, unless it was
to discredit America in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you can't think of anything, that is, any personal motive
that he might have had?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No. You mean envy, or something, or desire <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. For self-aggrandizement to draw attention to himself?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; and most people have that opinion. I don't think so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He never struck you as being that way?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He struck you as being just the ordinary, normal human being?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He struck me as being perfectly content with being the way he
was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you what kind of job he had with the coffee company?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't know if it was a mechanical one <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he seem to be satisfied with his job?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He said it was all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he impress you as having strong feelings about things or
not?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He didn't talk that much when he was over here, he really
didn't. I mean once, when I asked him several things about Russia, he said
nothing other than what I told you, in very general terms. I asked him how he
liked his job, and he said it was all right, that it wasn't any different from any
other factory. Most people seem to think that he had a desire to do something
that would show that he was somebody. But he didn't strike me as being that
way. I think he really thought he was somebody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he strike you as being a person of integrity?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Perfectly content&mdash;I mean he thought he was extremely
intelligent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think he was?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I thought that he was very articulate, but I mean I never discussed
anything with him in any great length to know whether or not he knew
what he was talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did you form the impression that he was very articulate?
You had the impression that he didn't talk very much?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; but I mean his accent was very good. I mean he pronounced
every syllable and the word endings were always pronounced, and he
didn't talk very&mdash;he was just very quiet. If he didn't want to answer something,
he didn't answer. You could be with somebody like that a year, and you would
get no answers&mdash;if he didn't care to give them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever feel particularly close to him, or that you had
any peculiar or any real rapport with the man at all?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I regarded him because he was my cousin, I guess. I
mean I wanted to see him settled and happy, naturally; and if I could have
helped him in any way, just as my mother, we all would have. I mean he didn't
have too easy a life. I liked Lee. He didn't strike me as being violent or
definitely not one who could commit such an act.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think that Lee would be liked by most people?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why not?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Because he wasn't friendly. He would be liked by a certain
type of person and hated by other types.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, that is the thing I am trying to bring out, and it is a
difficult thing to come at, and I wish you would tell me what you think about
this, how this strikes you, because it is difficult to frame a question with regard
to it. We all know that sometimes people respond differently to different human
beings, since each person is different and may have an entirely different response
to the same thing many times. According to some of the information we
have Lee was not liked by all kinds of people, and as you indicated, you did
like him, but you didn't think Lee would be liked by people generally. I wish
you would just tell us really what you think about this, and why.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, because of his manner&mdash;I think people thought that he
thought he was somebody, you know, and they wanted to knock him down a peg.
And his entire presentation, I mean his walk&mdash;he was very erect&mdash;he minded
his own business, and I don't think he liked petty gossip and things like that,
and, of course, those people are varied in mind, and it would take a perverted
mind, if he did this (assassination). Anyway, just like the way in the Army;
they said that the ones who came up through the ranks used to lead the college<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
graduates, and so forth, a dog's life, because they had a certain manner about
them, you know, where they just automatically thought they knew more just because
they had a degree. Lee didn't have a degree or anything like that, but I
think he was much more intelligent than the grades obviously indicated, although,
as I said, I never really discussed anything with him. My theory of it was that he
was intelligent, and so that type of person is usually disliked by this other group.
And I don't know if that&mdash;that is as clear as mud, I guess, or actually he stayed
with a certain class because his finances only allowed him to be with that particular
group, probably, and he didn't like them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you thought that was very much of a problem?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Right; and even though he didn't have any money, he was a
different type child, you know. I mean, like I am saying, he was not a rough
type of child, or anything like that, since certainly on Exchange Alley he had a
lot of opportunity to deviate from the right path, you know. But he never
went into any of those barrooms or pool halls, or anything like that, you know.
I guess, the other ones, he just didn't have the money to keep up with, but his
mother reared him to be like that. And I guess he could live within himself,
because he trained himself like that. I mean he never played with the other
kids, and when he came home from school he read, and whether he was always
reading this stuff, I don't know, but, anyway, he read everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever have any knowledge or had you heard that he
was reading anything on Marxism or communism?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know anything about that unless&mdash;anyhow, he was
trained, and he would read encyclopedias like somebody else would read a novel,
and that is how he was trained.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you think now, with the information that you have, both
from reading newspapers and also coupled with the knowledge of Lee Oswald,
do you think Lee Oswald actually did kill the President?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. All the evidence points to him, but he just never struck me
as capable of that particular act. I never thought he would be&mdash;I never thought
he was that maladjusted to want to prove to the world that he could commit
such an act for any personal gratification, unless, as I am saying, somebody
else was with him. But then, I don't think he was&mdash;well, he was such a quiet
type, that probably nobody else could ever get through to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did this impression that you have of Lee change any when
you heard he had been involved in this street fracas in connection with the
Fair Play for Cuba pamphlets that he was giving out, leaflets, and had some
difficulty out in the street?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, then, after that, I said, this kid&mdash;well, I just thought
he was probably harmless, and just then I said, well, he is just doing this
because why would he go marching, exposed all over Canal Street, and he voluntarily
goes to be interviewed. So, I mean, that type, I probably thought he was
harmless. And he was just shooting his mouth off. I mean, he didn't deny
<span class="locked">anything&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that didn't seem inconsistent with the proposition that
he was a loner, and it doesn't, really, but it didn't seem inconsistent to you?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't understand what you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You said the fellow was pretty quiet?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And he stayed pretty much to himself?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And then here you find him in the street handing out leaflets in
connection with Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and did you hear that he was
a member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee here in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; he said that after on television, or all of that came out
after. He must have been interviewed by WDSU shortly thereafter; <span class="locked">however&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know whether they showed that the first time, and they
reran all of that after the assassination, but, you know, it was because my
family had told me&mdash;well, the policeman had told my sister, well, that a lot of
these people do that around here, and it is not against the law, just the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
that they are disturbing the peace. I mean these are just boys&mdash;that's what
he said, "they are just boys, and I handle a lot of them like that." And then
after I saw it on television, he didn't deny anything, and he said out and out
that he was a Marxist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My question is basically, did this surprise you, based on the
past experiences that you had with him? And did it surprise you that all of
a sudden he was in the street handing out leaflets?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; it did, because he didn't say anything, but then, after
something happens, then you start formulating your opinions, of course. But
I mean he seemed to be perfectly content, and particularly after he met Marina.
But then in other theories that were expounded, that perhaps because he was
turned down by Russia and then turned down by Fidel, that perhaps he wanted
to show them that he could commit such a great act without the help of any
others, and still they didn't want him to work for them, you <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is the theory that you have thought of since the assassination?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is a theory that you have thought up since the assassination?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, because everybody yells&mdash;it just didn't strike me, so if
there was any reason, that just seemed to be the most logical one. But then,
on the other hand, and I know now that I am looking back on all this, and I
don't think that Khrushchev really turned him down at first, and then let him
have access to all of Russia, you know. I don't think he was just turned down
immediately, like that, and then being allowed to work in the factories, and go
from one city to the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Lee ever indicate to you that he didn't receive the kind of
treatment that he expected to receive when he went to Russia?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Nothing. I didn't press him on that, because I figured even if
somebody didn't like it, that they, after they had done such a thing, they
wouldn't probably want to come back and just, you know, do nothing but knock
it. He wouldn't anyway, since everybody was so horrified that he left, that
he, you know, that he wouldn't admit that big of a mistake. I don't think he
could have realized that, because, I mean, as I am saying, he liked to do what
he wanted to do. And as an individual he never did really seek company. But
then, no Communist lives like the Communists, anyway&mdash;they live like capitalists,
and just preach the doctrine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I think you indicated in response to my question as to whether
or not you thought that Lee had done it, that it all looks very much that way
and that the evidence points that way, but what do you believe? Do you believe
he did it?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. On circumstantial evidence, but I don't&mdash;there have been so
many conflicting reports, you know, as to two guns, and one person supplying
the telescope, and another stating that that telescope had already been mounted;
so, if there were, I&mdash;it could have been more than one shot actually, or I mean
shot from more than one place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever see Lee in possession of a weapon of any kind
when he was here in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see any rifle in his apartment?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever mention that he had a rifle?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of anything else that you can remember about
Lee that I didn't ask you about that you think the Commission should know?
If you can, I would like to have you put it in the record.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know of any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you interviewed by the FBI?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many times?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Once. My mother and I at the same <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell me how many times, up at your house, you were
interviewed either by yourself or when your mother was there?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think the FBI was there twice primarily for my mother, and
I talked to one of the Secret Service men once myself. My mother was there,
I mean, but he was talking to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To the best of your recollection that is all, the only time that
either the Secret Service or the FBI have been in touch with you?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If you can't think of anything else that you want to add at this
point, I don't have any other questions. I would like to thank you very much
for the cooperation that you have given to us. I want to express on behalf of
the Commission our thanks for coming here and being as cooperative as you
have been.</p>

<h2 id="t180"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_CHARLES_MURRET" id="TESTIMONY_OF_CHARLES_MURRET">TESTIMONY OF CHARLES MURRET</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Charles Murret was taken on April 7, 1964, at the Old Civil
Courts Building, Royal and Conti Streets, New Orleans, La., by Mr. Albert E.
Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Charles Murret, 757 French Street, New Orleans, after first being duly sworn
testified as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are Charles Murret, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you live at 757 French Street in New Orleans, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Murret, Mr. Rankin, general counsel of the Commission,
transmitted to Mrs. Lillian Murret, who is your wife, a letter in which he enclosed
Senate Joint Resolution 137, authorizing the creation of a Commission to
investigate the assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy; Executive
Order No. 11130 of President Lyndon B. Johnson, appointing that Commission
and fixing its powers and duties, and a copy of the rules and regulations under
which we take testimony before the Commission and also by way of deposition,
such as this one. Did she receive those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you see them, and read them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did read them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am Albert E. Jenner, Jr., member of the legal staff of the Commission,
and the Commission is now performing its duties of making inquiries
of the various people such as you, who, during their lifetime, came into contact,
in the ordinary course of their lives, with various people who are part of this
ball of wax. We are looking into the background of Lee Harvey Oswald in an
attempt to determine if possible the motive for this tragic event which occurred
November 22, 1963, which of course was the assassination of the President. In
that connection, we would like to ask you a few questions about what you
know, if anything, in that regard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. First, do you have a nickname?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is that nickname?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Dutz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Dutz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How do you spell that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. D-u-t-z. That's a name that my uncle gave me years ago and
it caught on, with me being in the fight game and all, and it just stuck with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say your uncle gave you that nickname?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; he was the one that gave me that name, and it stuck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you do much prizefighting?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; oh, I had a couple of bouts, but I never did make a career
of it, or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How old a man are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. 63; just made 63.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were born and raised in Louisiana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your family were all born Americans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, you have a fine family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your wife and your children are very proud of you, by the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How many children do you have, four or five?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have one who is studying for the priesthood, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he's over in Mobile studying, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He finished law school before he entered this institute in Mobile,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. He enrolled in the service. He had this 1-A hanging
over him, so he just went in and put in his 2 years, and came back, and to my
surprise he never took a leave, but he went on back to college, and he got all
kinds of honors in college, and then he decided to be a priest and enrolled with
the Jesuits over at Mobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have another son who is, I believe, with the Squibb Co.,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; that's John. He's with Squibb &amp; Co. now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I understand that he is also a pretty good baseball player,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have three boys and two girls, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; three boys and two girls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were all three boys interested in athletics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All interested in baseball?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had baseball equipment, like gloves and things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What are your boys, right handed or left handed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. They are all right handed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they ever loan their equipment, particularly gloves, to Lee
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not that you know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I think it's no secret that Mrs. Murret, your wife, did lend
one of their gloves to Lee Harvey Oswald one time to play ball when he was in
high school; did you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, she could have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She could have, and you wouldn't have known about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But all of those gloves would have been gloves for boys who are
right handers then, isn't that right, since all three of your boys are right
handed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, that's right. They are all right handers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then the gloves were for the left hand, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, that's correct, the left hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know Marguerite Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes, I know her. I never could get along with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You couldn't get along with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; she was quite a bit younger than my wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You're talking about Lillian Murret, your wife, and Marguerite's
sister, now, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know a man by the name of John Pic, or Ed Pic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Ed is all I knew him by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see him once in a while?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, I saw him just by chance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you did see him once in a while over the years, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes and I still do, as a matter of fact, but not very often.
He has been with T. Smith, Stevedores, for many, many years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does he have a responsible position with T. Smith?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, I imagine, because he has been there for so many years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he ever a stevedore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think he has just been an office man, to my knowledge, but his
firm is in that line of business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember his marriage to Marguerite Claverie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I didn't attend the wedding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you knew they were married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you know that some difficulty arose eventually in that
marriage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They didn't get along?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they separated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Since your wife has given us most of that information, we will
just skip some of that, but that marriage did end in divorce, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They had one child, John Edward Pic, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see them once in a while during this period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; they lived close in the neighborhood, so I would see them
pretty often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember her divorce from John Pic and subsequent marriage
to a man by the name of Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What business was he in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. The insurance business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he an insurance collector?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was not an insurance salesman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, he was a collector. He collected premiums for his company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do remember that Marguerite married Lee Oswald, and a
couple of children were born of that marriage, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Robert Lee and Lee Harvey, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember the birth of Lee in 1939?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall when they lived on Alvar Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Alvar? Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I think that's where they were living when he died.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; our records show that he died in August 1939, and Lee was
born a couple of months after he died; do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I don't know the exact month, but I remember it was right
after he died.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she do after her husband died, after she had the
child? Did she go to work, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I couldn't swear to that. I don't know if she inherited anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
from the insurance, from Lee dying, or not. It wasn't any of my business, so
I didn't ask about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mind your own business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right; that's what I did then, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall her living in and around New Orleans then, after
Mr. Oswald died?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, yes; I imagine so, but then she moved to Texas, and I
think she married this man over there sometime after that, by the name of
Ekdahl, or something like that. It's a hard name to pronounce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever meet Mr. Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; never in my life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There has been some evidence in these depositions about a picnic
that was held over at Covington, La., which was attended by Marguerite and
her three children and Mr. Ekdahl; do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't know anything about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What kind of a boy was Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I'll tell you: I didn't take that much interest in him. I
couldn't tell you anything about that, because I didn't pay attention to all that.
I do think he was a loud kid, you know what I mean; he was always raising
his voice when he wanted something from his mother, I know that, but I think
a lot of times he was just the opposite. He liked to read, and he stuck by himself
pretty much in the apartment the way I understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you and Marguerite get along all right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Not too well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not too well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the reason for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, it was due to her disposition, more or less. She always
thought she was right, and she would get aggravated at anybody that disagreed
with her, and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you avoided open controversy with her, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, yes; I didn't want to run head-on into anything like that.
For that reason I always did pretend like everything was all right, but I never
did think a house was big enough for two families, to that extent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did there come a time then when they left New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did they go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I imagine so, but I don't know where they went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But they did leave your house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; they sure did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you didn't hear from them for a while, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, my wife might have heard from them, and she might even
have told me, but I didn't take any interest in that after they left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You just didn't follow that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did there come a time, along in 1954, in the winter of 1954,
about January or something like that, that they returned to New Orleans? Do
you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't remember what year it was, but they came back to New
Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They did come back to New Orleans; you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lee was a young man then&mdash;a teenager, is that correct, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And 13, 14 years old?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. About that, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember him being about that age when they returned
to New Orleans?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he started high school here, I believe, is that right, or do
you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I think so. I mean, I can't fix the year and all those
details, but they did come back here, and he went to high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you remember about him as to his personality when he
returned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, couldn't remember the first one, to compare it to the second
time. I mean, I couldn't say he actually changed in any certain way, because
I couldn't remember how he was the first time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They lived with you for awhile when they returned to New
Orleans, didn't they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember, or were you conscious of the fact, that they
were living in New York City before they returned to New Orleans on that
occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I couldn't swear to that, but judging from what the wife
said, I mean, that's probably what happened. She had told me that they were
in New York; I remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember when they returned here from New York that
they lived over on St. Mary Street, or Exchange Alley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I remember Exchange Alley. I remember 1 day in particular,
and I think it was on carnival, or somewhere in the carnival season. I don't
know the date any more. They went back to Texas from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At any rate you remember that they left and went to Texas,
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Let me put it this way. I think they did, but I lost contact with
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But they did leave New Orleans again, after living at Exchange
Alley, didn't they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; they went back to Texas. Do you mean the second time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I recall my wife telling me that&mdash;that they had moved
back to Texas, but I don't know the date or anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was the next time that you saw either of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, the next time was when he came to New Orleans, and
stayed at our house. That was just a year ago in May, I think. I don't remember
what month, but it was about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About a year ago or in that neighborhood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes. That's when Lee came to town, and wanted to look for
an apartment, and said he was going to get a job, and that he would like to
stay with us until he found something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right; now, tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, when I walked in the house, he was standing in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was after you came home from work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were surprised to see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; that's right. I was surprised all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. What happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. My wife said, "Do you recognize who this is?" and I said, "Yes,"
and I said, "It looks like he has grown up or something." Of course, he looked
older, but he hadn't changed too much in appearance, I don't think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of course, this was Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The same boy, but you say he had grown up a little more, is
that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Physically, at least?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you heard anything about him in the meantime?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not a thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he tell you on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. What did he tell me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; didn't you help him put some stuff in your garage? Didn't
you go to the bus station and get his luggage and things and bring them to
the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Did I help him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't remember that. I don't remember helping him with any
luggage, not that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't believe it was even that next day. It was a couple
of days afterward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right; it is your recollection that it was a couple of days
later, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you take him with you to pick up his luggage at the bus
station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you sure now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would it be possible that you did that, but you just don't remember
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. You mean gone to the bus station with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; and picked up his luggage for him, and perhaps you don't
recall it at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I might have. I just don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, tell me what you recall his luggage consisted of at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I'll tell you; it might have been a duffelbag, or something;
I'm not sure of that. I don't remember what all it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he have a Marine duffelbag, like soldiers use&mdash;that sort of
thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, it was a bag; I guess it was a duffelbag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it have a name on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I didn't see any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember going in your car to the bus station to get
his luggage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I remember doing that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you drove?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I drove.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could Lee drive a car, to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever drive a car, to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see him driving an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How many duffelbags were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think there were two of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What else did he have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's all that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he have any cardboard boxes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he have any suitcases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Not that I saw; I don't think he had any suitcases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you put this luggage in your car, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he do that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; he put them in my car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see him doing that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you stay close to the locker in which this luggage was
contained?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't believe I did. I sat at the wheel of the car. I
asked him if he wanted a lift, but he said no, but I know he had two duffelbags
at least. I sat at the wheel of the car, to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right; you reached home, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the car unpacked then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; by Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lee did the unpacking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; he didn't want any help, so I didn't help him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your impression of Lee then, after he had appeared
at your house after all those years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I don't know, but I just couldn't warm up to him, but he
said he wanted to find a job and get an apartment and then send for his wife
in Texas, so I wasn't going to stand in his way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he get an apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, that was out on Magazine Street, but as far as the number
is concerned, I don't know it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember Lee's wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When he got the job, did he call his wife on the phone and have
her come over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did she come over with a Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; they drove on into New Orleans, and I met them, and I told
the lady, I said, "I'm glad to have met you," but if she would walk in this
door now, I wouldn't recognize her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the lady, do you mean Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right; what happened after Marina and Mrs. Paine arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, after we greeted them and everything, we decided to go up
to the apartment on Magazine, and I had Lee ride with me, I think, and the
others rode in the station wagon behind us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lee rode with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the station wagon pretty packed with the luggage and
everything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; it was pretty loaded, because Mrs. Paine had her two
children with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. While they were living on Magazine Street, did they come and
visit you or your family at your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, if they did, it was while I wasn't there. They must have
come in the daytime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, tell me about the trip over to Mobile; who went over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. My daughter Joyce, her two children, and Marina and the baby,
and Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did this come about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, her brother being in the seminary, he heard that Lee
was here and he wanted to see him. He wondered if we could bring Lee up
there to visit him, because he said he would like to see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then it wasn't at Lee's request that this trip was made over to
Mobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you drive them over?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long were you there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Oh, just from Saturday morning to Sunday evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Lee give some kind of an address to the students over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; but it was just for the faculty and the school over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just for the boys and the faculty at the school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I was there&mdash;not to listen to the speech now, but we were on
the grounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you didn't listen to the talk Lee gave at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How about Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; Marina and my wife&mdash;none of us went in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you returned to New Orleans the next day, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you pay all the expenses of that trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Lee Oswald making very much money at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I don't remember that. I didn't ask him that, how much he was
making.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. My impression was that he didn't have money to pay for the
trip or the motel or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You paid it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see any communistic literature or leaflets or pamphlets
relating to communism, or anything like that that could be termed subversive
in any sense of the word, in Lee Oswald's apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I saw a picture in his apartment, a picture of Castro, on
the mantel there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the mantel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; it was there after he was arrested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Last summer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In August it was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see Lee in a television interview here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, no; but I heard him over the radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, he called up my wife and told her that he was going
to be on television, so we turned on the television, but he was on the radio
instead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did hear him on the radio; did you listen to the program?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; not all of it, but enough of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Murret, did you ever try to teach Lee how to drive an
automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I didn't try to teach him that, but I tried to teach him to
talk American to his little child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your discussion with him on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. There was no discussion. I just told him, I said, "Why don't
you teach your child how to speak the English language?" But he didn't give
me an answer to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever have a discussion with him as to why he left
Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever have any discussion with him as to his political
views in connection with Russia, as to what he thought of Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, I didn't. To tell you the truth, after he defected to Russia
and went there to live and everything, I just let it go out the window. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
figured, "What's the use?" and then after he came back here and got into this
radio thing about Castro, and communism, and these leaflets and all, I didn't
worry myself any more about him. My main concern was keeping peace in
the family and seeing that he didn't disrupt anything around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, you sort of gave up on him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I sure did, but now, Marina, I asked her how she liked America,
and her face broke out in a big smile, like a fresh bloom, and she said, "I like
America."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mr. Murret, did anything occur that I haven't asked you
about that you think might be helpful to the Commission in its investigation
of all the circumstances and facts surrounding this matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you have the privilege of reading and signing your deposition,
or you can waive that privilege and let the reporter transcribe your
testimony, and it will be forwarded to Washington. What do you prefer to do
in that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I will waive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You wish to waive the reading and signing of your deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, thank you for coming in, Mr. Murret; that's all the
questions I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He was a hard one to get to know. You just couldn't get to
know him at all, and I don't think he had much consideration for anyone, especially
for his mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You arrived at that opinion over the period of time that you had
contact with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; and the thing that was so odd to me was that he seemed
to always be trying to prove himself, that he was so independent. For example,
he wouldn't let me help him with the luggage, and things like that.
He wanted to do it all himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you let him do it by himself, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Absolutely. It didn't matter to me, if he wanted to go ahead
and do it that way. I just, you know, lost all interest in him after all these
things happened. You just couldn't figure him out.</p>

<h2 id="t188"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_JOHN_M_MURRET" id="TESTIMONY_OF_JOHN_M_MURRET">TESTIMONY OF JOHN M. MURRET</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of John M. Murret was taken on April 7&ndash;8, 1964, at the Old
Civil Courts Building, Royal and Conti Streets, New Orleans, La., by Mr. Wesley
J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">John M. Murret, having been first duly sworn, was examined and testified
as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am a member of the legal
staff of the President's Commission investigating the assassination of President
Kennedy. Staff members have been authorized to take the testimony of witnesses
by the Commission pursuant to authority granted to the Commission
by Executive Order No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution
of Congress No. 137. I want to give you a copy of the Executive order and
the joint resolution to which I have just referred, and also a copy of the rules
of procedure adopted by the Commission governing the taking of testimony of
witnesses. (Producing documents and handing to witness.) Those rules provide
that technically a witness is entitled to 3 days' notice before he is required
to testify before the Commission or to give testimony to a staff member. I
know that you didn't get 3 days' notice. Witnesses are entitled to waive the
notice requirement, and I hope and assume that you will be willing to do that
since you are here, and we will go right ahead with the testimony. Are you
willing to waive the 3 days' notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Thank you. We want to inquire of you briefly this morning
concerning your contact with Lee Oswald while he was here in New Orleans
during the summer of 1963. Before we get into the details of that, however,
will you state your full name for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. My full name is John Martial Murret.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. 6622 Louis XIV Street, New Orleans, La.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. By whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. E.&nbsp;R. Squibb and Sons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long have you worked for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Approximately 4 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What do you do for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I am a pharmaceutical sales representative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Am I correct in understanding that you are Lee Harvey
Oswald's cousin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are a brother to Marilyn Murret and the son of Mr. and
Mrs. Charles Ferdinand Murret?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Charles Murret is also known as Dutz Murret, is he not,
D-u-t-z?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you born here in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you obtained your primary and secondary education here
in the New Orleans school system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you go to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Holy Rosary primary and St. Aloysius High School and St.
Louis University and Loyola University.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you hold a degree from Loyola University?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. A Bachelor's Degree?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. A Bachelor's Degree.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you major in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Secondary education, minor in chemistry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have occasion to see Lee Oswald during the summer
of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us about that, starting with the first time you
saw him. Tell us the circumstances under which you met him, the conversations
that you had. Tell us about the various times that you did see him during
the summer of 1963, what you did during that period of time, as far as Oswald
is concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, actually there was not too much contact that I did have
with him. Since I did live in the house and <span class="locked">did&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At 757 French Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. 757 French Street. The first contact I think I had with him,
we ordinarily&mdash;sometimes when I am working in that particular neighborhood,
I would come home for lunch, and he was there at this particular occasion with
his little bag and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now can you tell me approximately when that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Tell you the truth, I can't recall, but as you mentioned, you
know, during the summer. Evidently it was during the summer. I am not too
sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would it have been some time in May perhaps of 1963, or can't
<span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I can't recall. I could have recalled then, but I am kind of
confused now on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you came home to lunch on this particular day and Oswald
was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He was gone to the grocery. When he came back, that is when,
you know, well, like my mother said, she said, "Guess who was here," and I
think I guessed it, you know, and he went to the grocery to get a loaf of bread,
I think it was, and he just came back. But there was no particular other contact
that I could say I had with him other than&mdash;you know, he talking about
maybe Russia or something, but mostly, you know, the food and drink and, you
know, different environments that they have. That is the only thing I can say
about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say that he did talk about his time in Russia, and that
basically it was in terms of the kind of living conditions that they had and the
way the people live their lives in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate to you in any way that he had received better
treatment while he was in Russia than other Russians, or did you gain an impression
about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, I couldn't you know, actually say that, but&mdash;in fact, I
couldn't, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you at all why he went to Russia in the first place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No. In fact, I didn't inquire or feel that it was any of my particular
business why he did, but the only thing I can say, he just went. I just
didn't want to pry into his business, you know, or anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you anything about his experiences in Russia, other
than in general terms as far as living conditions and that sort of thing is
concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, his experience working in the factories where he had
gotten work. Other than that&mdash;that is the only particular.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you what kind of a factory he worked in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I really don't recall if it was a photographic factory or something,
you know, similar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you that he was working in the field of photography?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I know he was trying to acquire positions here in the city of
New Orleans either as a photographer or working in a photographic shop or as
a draftsman. I had known that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he mention anything about any hunting activities that he
might have engaged in while he was in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. In the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you why he decided to come back to the United
States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, not directly. Maybe my mother tried to get it out of him,
but he just said he was back, and he got married and so forth and wanted to
come back to the States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He didn't go into very much detail as far as his experience in
Russia? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As I understand it, he stayed at the house at 757 French Street
for about a week? Is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Actually stayed there? I couldn't recall offhand, you know, how
long he stayed there, even though, you know, I lived there, but I can't recall
whether it was a week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, or what it might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During this time, he was looking for a job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether he found one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, it was kind of hard for him, you know, finding a job. I
do know that he did find a job. He was working. It was indicated that he did
work for a coffee factory on Tchoupitoulas or Magazine Street or some place
around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you that he was having trouble finding a job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, no. In fact, I was interested in actually him finding a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
job, to be truthful, and I would have thought, personally, you know, even the
way he was dressed, it was kind of difficult for him finding a job the way his
appearance looked, you know, when he first came back, with no clothes and so
forth looking for a job. It was sort of impossible for him to get a job. There
is no doubt about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He didn't make too good an appearance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir; he could have, but he just didn't have the clothes, evidently
the money, for him to make the appearance. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now did you ever go over to the apartment that Oswald apparently
rented on Magazine Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I knew where he lived. In fact, possibly I had drove Marina and
Lee to the apartment, but I have never stepped out of the car or actually been
in front of the particular home or inside the home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Commission has some information to the effect that you
tried to teach Oswald how to drive a car. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, like I say, he was always home, you know, on 757 French
Street looking at TV or whatever it may be. It just so happened sometimes I
work late, come home maybe 5:30 or 6 o'clock, and I didn't have any time during
the day to teach him, and this one particular night&mdash;I had told him, you know,
I was going to take him out, that he should learn how to drive and so forth,
that it may be helpful to him on getting a job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He told you that he didn't know how to drive a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I can't directly say, you know, that he did, but the impression
was&mdash;I could actually say that he did not know how to drive a car before he
got behind the wheel. I actually had to tell him how to start the car and so
forth, what to do on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now on this particular night that you took him out in the
car, would you tell us how he handled the car and just what you and he did,
where you drove the car, how you practiced with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, this was at nighttime, as I was saying. I forget&mdash;I guess
it was after supper. And I drove him to City Park, which is the city park here
in New Orleans. It was by the golf driving range where they have these little
parking partitions, yellow lines for parking places for the golfers, and I had
brought him here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You had driven the car from your house on French Street over
to the parking lot in the park?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; and I was actually trying to teach him how to back
up. It was a pushbutton car, a Dodge, a 1960 Dodge, a rather big car, no power
steering or anything, and I was just trying to tell him, you know, how to go
into the parking lanes and also backing into the parking lanes, and he was
awkward, I mean as far as learning is concerned. You could see that he had
never driven a car before. That is my impression of this. So after&mdash;we stayed
there awhile and then I let him drive the car, you know, through the park and
back home again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You let him drive the car back to the house on French Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir; it was through the park. There was no traffic or
anything. Nobody was in the park.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It was just a drive through the park?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did he seem to handle the car at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I had to stay next to him, tell you the truth. Evidently
he could handle the car&mdash;I mean just steering&mdash;because it was just regular
gas and brake. That is all it is, you know. There is nothing to that. But in
traffic, I really couldn't say how he could have handled it, you know, the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you go out with him again after that with the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; that was the only time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever let him take the car by himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether he ever took your car by himself without
your permission?</p>

Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir; I always had the car working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he have access to any other automobiles while he was here
in New Orleans, as far as you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. To my knowledge, no; not of my family's possessions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have a brother who is studying to be a Jesuit <span class="locked">priest&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Mobile, Ala., do you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did there come a time in the summer of 1963 when Lee Oswald
went to Mobile, Ala.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you go along?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I was supposed to. I was in Houston at the time, we had a sales
meeting in Houston, and I didn't make the trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did not go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir; I did not go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who all went on that trip? Do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. As I recall, it must have been my mother and father and Marilyn,
and that is it, and Lee and Marina and the baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you talked with your brother, the Jesuit student, since
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I have; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you about Oswald's appearance at the seminary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never discussed that particular event?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk about Oswald at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I did. In fact, the next time I had seen my brother was at my
wedding. You see, he doesn't come in New Orleans at all. And I had asked
him what kind of talk he gave, because I was interested in what kind of talk
he did give and what impression he made on the Jesuits, and, like he said, you
know, he didn't speak other than what the conditions were, you know, in
Russia, and how he lived and the food and drink and so forth, and I think the
other boys were asking him questions or trying to ask him questions. He may be
evading the questions, but other than that, that is the only connection I had
with my brother, you know, just asking him about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was at your wedding? Is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was the date of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That was October 5, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Sixty-three, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did your brother indicate&mdash;did your brother, Eugene, indicate
his opinion of Lee Oswald to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, his mind was&mdash;as far as his thinking was concerned, there
is no doubt but that he thought in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is what your brother thought?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. That is what my brother thought; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your brother, of course, is studying to be a Jesuit priest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever talk to Oswald about religion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now other than the first time that you saw Oswald when he
was there at 757 French Street on that day when you came home for <span class="locked">lunch&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And the contact that you had with him at 757 French Street
until he moved out, did you have any other contact with Oswald during the
summer of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir; just only when, you know, he came to the house some
Sundays maybe to eat or something on that order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you meet Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Not in clear English, but made signs and so forth, and I actually
didn't want to, you know, get involved, but I actually couldn't speak to her,
you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form an opinion as to whether or not Marina could
speak English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I don't think she could, and I was amazed how fast that
she did pick it up, you know, when she was on television and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After the <span class="locked">assassination&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You observed a distinct and surprising improvement in her
use of the English language, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. From the time that you saw her in New Orleans here in the
summer of 1963 until the time that she appeared on television after the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have occasion to observe Lee Oswald and Marina
together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Around the television; yes. I think that is about the only time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form any opinion as to how they got along with each
other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. To me they got along pretty well, they got along pretty well.
In fact, they had a television program on one day&mdash;I forget what it was, on a
Friday night&mdash;pertaining to a circus, and it was in Russia, and they were
pretty well enthused about it being it was Russian, and it was the first time
they had ever seen something like that. In fact, I think they had either the
Olympics or some sort of sporting event in Russia at the time, and they were
quite impressed, because it was the first time they had ever seen something
like this, but other than that, it seemed like they got along pretty well. I
didn't see anything out of the ordinary, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There was never any indication of strain or hostility in their
relationship, as far as you could tell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir; not that I could see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss <span class="locked">politics&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. With Oswald at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear him mention President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Or Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form an opinion about Oswald's general character
from your observations and experience with him in 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. In the summer of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Actually, he probably didn't have any other choice of doing anything.
It was kind of hard, I guess, for him to get along. Like I say, his appearance
in general&mdash;I mean, just by looking at him, he just didn't have the
clothes or anything to do anything right. In other words, everything that he did
was wrong if he did go look for a job and get turned down and so forth. It was
kind of hard for him after a bit. Someone would have helped him, but he didn't
actually need any help. He wanted to do it on his own. You could have helped
him, you know, but he just didn't want any help. He wouldn't ask for anything,
I know that, he wouldn't ask for anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He struck you as sort of an independent, proud sort of fellow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He was proud, there is no doubt about it. He was proud.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think he was a fairly bright fellow, or did you form
an opinion about his intelligence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He was bright and he impressed me&mdash;you know, bright in a
different sense of the word. Now whether he thought in the right direction,
I really don't know, but he was&mdash;but he improved particularly, you know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
from the younger years that I had known him. He had improved tremendously
as far as intelligence is concerned and his vocabulary, and evidently he tried
to impress people, you know, with it, but he was impressive, he was impressive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He seemed to speak well and was articulate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Right, he was. He used words that an ordinary individual
wouldn't use in conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know that he was arrested by the New Orleans Police
Department some time during the summer of 1963 in connection with some
difficulties that he got into when he was distributing Fair Play for Cuba
Committee literature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you learn that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, when it was in the paper or when it was on television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. At the time. Either that or my parents had told me. I don't
recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have anything to do with getting him out of jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Nothing at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know that he was on a radio debate over at WDSU?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you hear him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I understand that Oswald actually called the house out there
and told you that he was going to be on the radio, did he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Right. He sure did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any discussions with him or see him after the
radio debate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. If I did see him, I didn't discuss it, you know, with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever at any time discuss with him this Fair Play
for Cuba Committee episode or his radio debate or anything in connection
with those events?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do I understand that your sister was involved in the events
that led to Oswald's release from jail? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. To my understanding, she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Did she tell me that? That is my oldest sister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is her name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Joyce O'Brien.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where does she live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. She lives in Beaumont, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The question was: Did she tell you that she had been involved
in getting Oswald out of jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I heard something to the effect that while he was in jail he
phoned the home. It just so happened my sister was there at the time, because
she very seldom comes in, and naturally you want to, you know, see if we could
get him out, and she is saying how did he get in there in the first place, and
she didn't want to get him out after she heard what he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She didn't want to get him out after she heard what he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know Oswald as a younger boy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; not closely. I can recollect, you know, when he was a
small boy, but no particular dealings with him. He was too small to hold
any conversation with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any recollection of what kind of a fellow he was
when he was a kid?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He was a nice kid. Just by his pictures and so forth, he was
real nice. To me he was harmful [sic].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Harmful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Harmful?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Harmless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How old are you, Mr. Murret?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I am 29.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Twenty-nine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are the youngest member of the Murret family? Is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever know Lee Oswald's older brother, Robert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you closer to Robert than you were to Lee, would you
say, or how much contact did you have with Robert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, I would say about the same. Actually they weren't here
in the city of New Orleans, you know, long enough to get close to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There was nothing that you knew about Lee Oswald's youth
that was particularly noteworthy or outstanding or would draw your attention
to him or would distinguish him from other boys of his age, that you can remember,
was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir; I couldn't say. I didn't have that much contact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now looking back over the summer of 1963, thinking about
your contact with Lee Oswald, is there anything that you can think of that
you did with him or any conversations that you had or anything of interest
that occurred during that time that we haven't talked about? If you can think
of anything else in that nature that we haven't mentioned, that you think would
be helpful to the Commission, we would like to have you tell us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Well, the only thing I can think of; like I say, it just so happens
that I was home all the time, but the telephone rang, you know, for him getting
a job or some employment agencies calling up asking, you know, for him to
contact the employment agencies because they had located him a job and so
forth, and the only thing I can recollect is an employment agency calling me
up one night, and couldn't get in contact with him, and I had to call the particular
coffee plant the next day, you know, saying that the agency wants to see
you, you know, right away, he has a job located for you&mdash;in photography I think
it was. So I had called him, and that was about the end of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did call Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you reach him at the coffee plant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he say anything when you told him that this employment
agency was looking for him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No; I was just hoping that this was the job that he was looking
for. Other than that, that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember the name of the employment agency?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir; I don't. They had maybe one or two that called up,
different ones, but it was amazing&mdash;not amazing, but evidently when he was
applying for these particular jobs he must have impressed them such that they
would let him know one way or the other, you know, whether they had a job for
him or not, rather than just pass it by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Lee own a suit of clothes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I think he did; yes, sir. It was during the summer, and it was
a woolen suit more so than a summer suit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether he wore that suit when he went looking
for a job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. He might have wore it once; yes, sir. That was the only suit
he had that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How much luggage did Lee have with him when he stayed out
at the place on French Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. I couldn't say. Just the bag that I saw, you know, just the
handbag which is similar to&mdash;you know, like a basketball equipment bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Something like an airline bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Yes; something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Just a <span class="locked">soft&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. Right, just a small bag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't remember what color it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If you can't think of anything else that you can remember or
that you think would be helpful, I have no more questions at this point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murret</span>. O.K.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I want to thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="t196"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_EDWARD_JOHN_PIC_JR" id="TESTIMONY_OF_EDWARD_JOHN_PIC_JR">TESTIMONY OF EDWARD JOHN PIC, JR.</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Edward John Pic, Jr., was taken on April 7, 1964, at the Old
Civil Courts Building, Royal and Conti Streets, New Orleans, La., by Mr. Albert
E. Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Edward John Pic, Jr., No. 6 Jay Street, Lake Vista, New Orleans, La., after
first being duly sworn, testified as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are Edward John Pic, Jr., is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your address, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No. 6 Jay Street, Lake Vista.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that J-A-Y?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is Lake Vista a suburb of New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes; it's on the Lake Pontchartrain frontage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you aware of the existence of the Warren Commission,
Mr. Pic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Well, I knew, you know, an investigation was started.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Pic, the Warren Commission was authorized by Senate
Joint Resolution No. 137. That legislation authorized the President of the
United States to appoint a Commission to investigate all the facts and circumstances
surrounding, and pertinent to, the tragic event of November 22, 1963,
which was the assassination of our President John Fitzgerald Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thereafter President Johnson, under Executive Order No. 11130
did appoint that particular Commission, of which His Honor, the Chief Justice
of the United States, Earl Warren, is Chairman. That Executive order, pursuant
to the legislation, directs the Commission, upon its creation, to investigate
all the facts and circumstances surrounding the tragic event of November 22,
1963, and also the subsequent death and course of conduct of Lee Harvey Oswald
and of Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>The Commission was authorized to create a legal staff, and one of our duties
is the taking of testimony, both in person before the Commission itself and by
deposition, such as we are doing here today, of anybody who might have touched
the lives of these people in any manner or in any capacity. Do you understand
what we are doing now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I must confess candidly that up until yesterday I was
under the impression that you were deceased, or at least no one knew where
you were, and then a witness whom I examined yesterday told me, to my surprise,
that you were very much alive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. I certainly am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have been seen occasionally by this witness on the street.
He said he had no occasion to speak to you, but that he recognized you. Now,
had I known that before, I would have transmitted to you in advance a letter
through the general counsel of the Commission, Mr. Rankin, in which you would
have been advised of the Commission's authority to take your deposition, and
you would have also received, enclosed with the letter, a copy of Senate Joint
Resolution 137 authorizing the creation of the Commission to investigate the
assassination of President Kennedy; a copy of the Executive Order No. 11130,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
of President Johnson appointing the Commission and fixing its powers and
duties, and a copy of the rules and regulations under which we take testimony
before the Commission itself, and also by way of deposition, as we are doing
here today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. May I say something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Surely; anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. I think it was some time after Christmas, possibly January, that
an agent of the FBI came to see me, and he knew whether I was still alive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I am just confessing my own stupidity and ignorance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. He just wanted to know if I knew anything about it, and I told him
I didn't; and that was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He didn't go into it any further than that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, that still doesn't justify my ignorance or misinformation.
Who was it that said&mdash;was it Will Rogers, that said the reports of his death
were very much exaggerated?</p>

<p>So I called you last night, and then in order that you might be assured that
you weren't being inquired of by some crackpot, I asked the Secret Service man
to contact you today, and he did, didn't he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And so you appeared voluntarily here; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mr. Pic, you are a native of this section of the country,
are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. I was born and raised in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Born and raised here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your wife the same way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes; my present wife; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were married at one time to Marguerite Oswald, or rather,
to Marguerite Claverie, who later married Oswald; is that right, Mr. Pic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that took place when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. 1929.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were both very young people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Right. I was born in August of 1907.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were married how long? Just give me your best estimate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. I guess about 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Three years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Somewhere around that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have difficulty in this marriage before it actually
terminated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Well, yes; things happened, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your marriage was terminated in divorce, wasn't it Mr. Pic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About how long did you actually live together before you
separated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Oh, about a year, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So then you separated, and a divorce followed in a couple of
years; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your business or occupation when you were married
to Marguerite?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. I was just classified as a clerk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In what company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. T. Smith &amp; Son.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you still with that company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. I am, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I suppose the nature of your work with the company has changed;
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes; it has, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you do now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. I am in the ship department as well as the tugboat department of
the company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have managerial supervision in the company now, Mr.
Pic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes; I am operating manager of the company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have major responsibilities with the company now; is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes, sir; right much. I have a big responsibility with the company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, at a point in your marriage to the then Mrs. Pic, who is
now Mrs. Oswald, there was a time when you didn't get along; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Will you tell me about that please? Just tell me in your own
words what difficulty you had with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Well, we just couldn't put two and two together and make it come
out to four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was no outside influence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No; none; definitely not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On either side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No; there wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You just figure you were two persons who couldn't jell; is that
just about a fair statement of your situation at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. That's right. We couldn't make it. We just couldn't get along, you
know, so we finally decided to quit trying and call the whole thing off; which
we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me this. Was she a nice girl. Would you right now be
able to look back and say whether she was what you would consider a nice
girl at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Oh, definitely, yes. She was a nice girl. I couldn't say anything
about Marguerite at all. It was just one of those things. We just couldn't get
along. We had a lot of friends and everything, but there was something that
kept things getting worse and worse. Maybe I had a rotten disposition, I don't
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You aren't trying to place the blame anywhere now, are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you have lived here in New Orleans all the intervening
years; haven't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there a child born of your marriage to Marguerite, Mr. Pic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that's John Edward Pic, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why did you give him that name, so he wouldn't be another
"Jr.," or II or III?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. I had nothing to do with that, sir. She named him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She gave him that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the child born before or after the separation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. After the separation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you aware that she was pregnant at the time of the
separation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. I was, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you discussed that with her, I presume?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that a mutual agreement, to separate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes, sir; we went to an attorney, the same attorney, and he worked
it out for us. We decided the best thing for us was to separate, and we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then you supported her; did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The child John Edward Pic was born then during the period of
the separation, but before the divorce, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you aware of the birth of the child?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then a divorce took place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About how long after the birth of the boy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Oh, I guess about a year and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About a year and a half?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was a decree entered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Under which you paid alimony to your former wife and child
support to your son?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Well, it was not a court decree as far as the alimony was concerned.
That was an arrangement made between her, myself and the attorney, that they
keep that out of the divorce decree, about alimony. That was a mutual understanding.
I agreed that I would give her as much as I could out of the salary I
would make.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did you make payments in the form of alimony to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. From the time of the separation up to 1950, I paid it. I sent monthly
checks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the same amount?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. The same amount; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you pay her any separate amounts during that time as
alimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No, sir; it was agreed with our attorney that she could have all the
furniture. I made no claim on anything. She took it all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have the distinct recollection that you paid her the
same amount each month up until 1950, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What were those amounts, if you can recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Let's see&mdash;I am trying to remember if I sent that semimonthly or
monthly. I think I sent those checks semimonthly. I sent her $20 semimonthly,
which was $40 a month I sent her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You sent her $40 a month until 1950?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then even though she remarried you still sent her $40 a month,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You knew she had remarried?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you remarry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. I remarried in 1939.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that your present wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was her maiden name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Marjorie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was her given name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Boensel. She had previously been married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she a widow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. When we got married, yes; she was a widow. Her husband had died.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you had any children from that marriage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Girl or boy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is her name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Martha.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How old is she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. 17 this July.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me this: Did you know from time to time where Marguerite
would be so that you would know where to send those checks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How? Did she communicate with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Well, up to the time she moved out of the city, I think I knew where
she lived, but I am trying to think where the next place she moved to when she
moved out of town. I think it was Fort Worth, Tex., or Brownsville; I just
don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, let me give you some addresses and let's see if they refresh
your recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From 1939 to 1941 on Alvar Street in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Alvar; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember when she lived on Alvar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then she lived for a while, about a year, at 1010 Bartholomew
in New Orleans; do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes, sir; since you mention it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then in 1942 at 2136 Broadway, New Orleans; do you remember
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. That's possibly right, but it don't ring a bell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember her being over in Algiers, 227 Atlantic Avenue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then about 1945 in Dallas, Tex., 4801 Victor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. I don't remember Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't remember Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No; she could have, but I don't remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember Benbrook, Tex., in 1946?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Covington, La., in 1946, in the summer of that year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Covington, no; I don't remember sending checks there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Fort Worth, Tex., 1947?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. I do remember her being there; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1505 Eighth Avenue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Well, the address I don't know, but I know she lived in Fort Worth
about then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do remember Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you definitely remember sending her $40 a month when she
was in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it was while she was in Fort Worth that the payments were
finally stopped, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Correct, sir; in 1950.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In 1950?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you transmit these checks to her, since she moved
around quite a bit, as we know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Well, I would get a cashier's check from the Whitney National Bank
in New Orleans and sometimes the City Bank Branch, which our company had
an account in, and I could get it through without a lot of red tape that way
since I worked for the company and all. Now, those addresses that you read
off to me, she probably kept me posted where she would be from time to time&mdash;you
know, let me know where to send the check.</p>

<p>Now, in 1950 I was of course still sending support to my son, and through
withholding I was able to claim him as a dependent, but I knew he was getting
up in age, 17, 18 years, and I made inquiry whether he was still going to school,
or was working, because the Treasury Department called me in and said I made
a claim for my son when he had filed a tax return himself and in fact claiming
his mother as a dependent, so I got in trouble with the Treasury Department
over that, because I didn't know he was working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you learn in 1950 eventually that your boy was in the Coast
Guard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Finally I did; yes. She sent me a picture of John, and to me it
looked like he was in the Navy, but I guess it was the Coast Guard. So anyway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
after they told me he was working, I went to see my attorney and explained it
to him that the boy had reached the age where he was self-supporting, and inasmuch
as I had remarried and she had remarried, it wasn't necessary that I
send her any more money, so I wrote her a letter and told her that I had no
further legal obligation as far as the law was concerned, so I advised her that
that would be the last check I would be sending her, and I heard no more from
her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you seen your son John?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No, sir; only on the picture; and that was just up to about the 1-year
age, that I actually seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did see him when he was about a year old?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes; up to about a year old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But from that time on to the present day, you have never seen
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No, I have never seen my boy since that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was the last time you saw Marguerite?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Oh, that's been a long, long time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could that have been as long a period as 37 years that you
haven't seen Marguerite?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Well, yes; that's about correct, sir; it's very close to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 37 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you never knew Lee at all; you never saw him, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't even know he was born, or when he was born, did
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No, sir; I knew she had two children now, but what their names
were, I didn't know that. Now, a few days after the assassination, which I
hate to mention, her name struck me all of a sudden, but I didn't think even
then that she was the Oswald mixed up in this, and her son, and all.</p>

<p>I said to my wife, "Honey, do you realize who that is?" and she said, "Yes,
I figured who it was all the time, but I didn't want to mention it to you and
bring all that up." I didn't realize that it was her boy at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you know her husband, Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No; I never met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You never did meet him and you never did hear of him, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. That's right; I never did even hear of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you know a man by the name of Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No; not to my knowledge; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you know she was married to him at one time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you known him up to that moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No; not till I read about him in the paper&mdash;that she had another
marriage and it broke up, I believe, or something. It was in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your boy John didn't communicate with you at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Never has; no, sir. I never got any word from John. I guess he
forgot about me. He was too young to realize, and maybe his mother never did
tell him about his old man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, to be completely charitable about it, you don't even know
if he knows you are alive, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You never can tell about those things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. No; you never know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, Mr. Pic, I appreciate your coming in today. I know it
has been some inconvenience to you. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Well, like I say, I never did know about her marriage to Mr.
Oswald, other than I had known that she remarried, and his name was mentioned
to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I understand that. Now, Mr. Pic, you have the right, if you
wish, to come in and read your deposition and sign it, or you may waive that
and this gentleman, the court reporter, will transcribe the deposition and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
will be sent by the U.S. attorney to Washington. Now what do you prefer to
do? Do you want to read and sign it, or do you want to waive that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pic</span>. Oh, I will waive it. I mean, the information I have is all I can give
you. My wife and I have known that we faced this ever since the assassination,
that it would come some day, but we just didn't want a lot of publicity or anything,
you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you may rest assured that the fact that you have testified
here will not be made known to any news reporters or any news media by anyone
in this room, and we appreciate your coming in and telling us what you
know about it.</p>

<h2 id="t202"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_JOHN_CARRO" id="TESTIMONY_OF_JOHN_CARRO">TESTIMONY OF JOHN CARRO</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of John Carro was taken on April 16, 1964, at the U.S. Courthouse,
Foley Square, New York, N.Y., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel
of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">John Carro, having been first duly sworn, was examined and testified as
follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am a member of the legal
staff of the President's Commission investigating the assassination of President
Kennedy. Staff members have been authorized to take the testimony of witnesses
by the Commission pursuant to authority granted to the Commission by
Executive Order No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution of
Congress No. 137.</p>

<p>Under the Commission's rules for the taking of testimony, each witness is
to be provided with a copy of the Executive order and of the joint resolution,
and a copy of the rules that the Commission has adopted governing the taking
of testimony from witnesses. The Commission will provide you copies of those
documents.</p>

<p>Under the Commission's rules for the taking of testimony, each witness is
entitled to 3 days' notice of his testimony. I don't believe you actually received
3 days' notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But since you are here, I don't believe there is any question
that you <span class="locked">will&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. There's no problem.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We want to inquire briefly of you today, Mr. Carro, concerning
your recollection of the contact we are informed that you had with Lee Harvey
Oswald when he lived here in New York at the time he was approximately 13
years old, back in 1953&ndash;54.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Before we get into that, would you state your full name for
the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Well, my name is John Carro.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. 56 Lakeside Drive, in Yonkers, State of New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where are you presently employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. I am employed with the mayor's office here in the city of New
York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are an assistant to the mayor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. An assistant to the mayor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. I was born in Orocovis, P.R.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. August 21, 1927.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you come to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. I came to the United States, I believe it was in 1937&mdash;'37.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you came to New York at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. New York City; yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you have lived in New York City ever since, or its environs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you outline briefly for us your educational background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Well, I went to junior high school and high school, college and
law school here. I attended Benjamin Franklin High School, Fordham University
and Brooklyn Law School. I graduated from law school in 1952. In
addition, I attended schools in the Navy, the hospital corps school, and I attended
one year at NYU, the School of Public Administration, under the city
executive program.</p>

<p>I am an attorney and have a B.S. degree from the University of Fordham.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you at any time engaged in the practice of law here in
New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Yes; I have. I have from the time I was admitted to practice
in February of 1956 been in the practice of law. Even at the present time,
although I am not, myself, actively engaged, I maintain a law partnership
where I practice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I understand that you were a probation officer, assigned as a
probation officer to the Domestic Relations Court.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Here in New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At what time did you first become so assigned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Well, I worked with the Probation Department of the Domestic
Relations Court, Children's Division, from early 1952 'til 1954. I am trying
to recollect&mdash;from 1952 to 1954. I believe it was up to October of 1954. It
may have been around September of 1954. I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us, after 1954 did you hold any other public
office or any <span class="locked">other&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Oh, yes; I worked from 1949 to 1952 as a social investigator for
the city of New York. From 1952 to 1954 I was probation officer of the Children's
Court. Then, in 1954 for about a month or so I was with the New York
City Police Department as a probationary patrolman and left to join the New
York City Youth Board where I worked as a social&mdash;I mean, a street club
worker, senior worker and supervisor. I worked with the New York Youth
Board for 4 years with their council of Social and Athletic Clubs, which is the
common name given to the "street gang project."</p>

<p>From 1958 to 1960 I was appointed to the State Commission Against Discrimination.
I worked with them as a field representative.</p>

<p>In 1960 to 1961 I worked for Mobilization for Youth, which is a privately
financed organization with Federal, State, and city funds and private funds,
developing a program for the youth, as an associate director, and from 1961
to the present I have been an assistant to the mayor of the city of New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Does your job with the mayor at the present time relate to
youth, or more <span class="locked">generally&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Yes, in the sense that I have liaison responsibility with the various
social service agencies, which included the Youth Board, the Department of
Correction and City Commission on Human Rights. I do a great deal of work
with education and youth, and I am in charge of the mayor's information center
and the mobile unit, and although that does not give me a direct relationship,
the leaning of my own background experience have been so that I have represented
the mayor on the President's Committee on Narcotics. I also have worked
with the Mobilization for Youth. I have sat in for the mayor on some of the
situations. I naturally tend to this kind of work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did you first become interested in this? Was this because
of your work as a probation officer or the work you did prior to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Well, I think it was a combination of both. I grew up in east
Harlem, and I belonged to a number of organizations, and actually I desired to
get social work experience, and when I went into the welfare department I found
out that I would enjoy it much better working with youth, and it was just
through reading about it, I happened to read&mdash;I heard that probation work
with youth&mdash;than welfare investigator, and while in probation I read
about the youth board work, and I liked the idea of a detached worker approach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
working in the streets, trying to reach the young people before they
came to court and had already committed a crime, and this is why I left the
police department, in the thought that I would like to do that.</p>

<p>I have an interest in young people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During the time that you worked as a probation officer did
you have occasion to make the acquaintance of Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Will you tell us everything that you can remember about
that in your own words?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Well, I was first assigned to the case, I believe it was about
April of 1953. This was a petition that had been brought before the court by
the attendance bureau relating to this boy, Lee Harvey Oswald, because of his
truancy from school. He had been absent quite a great deal of time on a
prior term, on a transfer to a new school; he had just neglected to attend
school altogether, and the Board of Education has a bureau who send out an
attendance officer to find out why the boy is not going to school. Apparently
their efforts were fruitless so that the attendance bureau of the board of education
had referred the matter to the court for a petition, and the mother had been
asked to come into court with the boy.</p>

<p>My recollection, as I recall, is that initially the mother did not bring him in
and the judge ordered a warrant for her to bring the boy, and when she did
come in with the boy a petition was drawn, alleging truancy, the judge made a
finding of truancy, and ordered that the boy be remanded to Youth House for
what they call a sociological study. The case is then assigned to a probation
officer in the court to make further investigation to bring back to the court for a
possible determination as to the case.</p>

<p>This is the instance that I came into the case. The judge having made a
finding and ordered an investigation, I was the probation officer assigned to do
the investigation in the case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The original finding that the judge made was that Oswald
was a truant, and the first finding also ordered Oswald to be committed in the
Youth House, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Remanded, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Remanded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Pending investigation, and for a sociological study while there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would the probation officer work with the boy while he was
in the Youth House or basically after he got out of the Youth House?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. No, actually the probation officer's job would be then to develop
a history of the family which would entail talking to the boy about the nature
of the difficulty which brought him before the court, talking to the parent as
to what the parent knew and the boy's whole background from early childhood,
whether there was trauma, whether he was a nailbiter, you know, the
whole family history, brother, sibling relationship, parental history, look into
the school record. In this particular instance it was most important because
there was a question of truancy. Also find out about the religious affiliation,
whether the boy went to church, look into the environmental surroundings,
where he lived; visit the home, talk to the boy, himself, about the nature of his
act and why he did the things he did, and actually, in essence, get a full report,
about as full as possible as to the boy's background, his parents, his whole
situation, make a recommendation to the court, get the reports from the school
as to what the probation officer deemed should happen in this instance.</p>

<p>Unlike the special sessions and other courts where the probation officers do
not make recommendations, in Children's Court the probation officer does make
a recommendation which the judge then can go along with or reject or take it
under consideration. This was aside from what was going on in Youth House.</p>

<p>In Youth House the boy that is sent there, every worker that has some contact
with the boy is required to write something about the contact, and they
are in fairly good position because they watch this boy in his off moments for
2 to 3 weeks, in his everyday activities, and he is also seen by a psychiatrist
while he is there, and then this report, along with what the probation officer has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
been able to get from visits to the home, the parents, talking to the boy himself,
is collated and put together, and this forms the basis for the material
that is given to the judge, so that the judge is in a better position to render a
decision of what should happen, whether this boy should be placed, whether
he should be returned home, whether he should be given therapy, whether he
should be put on probation, strict probation, or whatever the judge would deem
in the particular instance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In this particular case you recall that Oswald was remanded
to Youth House?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Yes, he was remanded from the very first day to the Youth
House because he had not even bothered to report to school. I forget whether
he had just turned 13 or he was still 12, but in New York State we have a law
that requires each boy to attend school until at least 16, and this was a young
man of tender age who had at this point taken it upon himself to just not
bother to go to school any more, and furthermore, this was not the usual hooky-playing
type&mdash;when I say hooky, the type of boy who does not go to school, to
truant with his other friends, to go to the park, fish, play, or whatever it is.
This is a boy who would not go to school just to remain home, not do anything.</p>

<p>The judge felt that since there was no father figure at home and it was just a
mother who worked, that this was not a salutary situation for a boy this tender
age to be in, and he felt he wanted to find out a little more about this boy before
he made decision, and consequently he asked for the study at the Youth House.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know who worked with Lee Oswald at the Youth House?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. No; I only know that&mdash;I did not know the staff by name. I had
been there on some occasions, so I do not know specifically who. I know he was
seen by the psychiatrist, Dr. Hartogs, because they do send you their report
afterwards, and I did receive a Youth House report, but I don't recall who
specifically had the daily contacts with Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How does it come that you remember receiving Dr. Hartogs'
report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Well, because since he was sent there and he is the doctor who does
the report, this comes back to the court, and it is incorporated into the final
report before it is put out, and Dr. Hartogs, I knew, was the one who did it for
the court. He was the chief psychiatrist or so. All the reports were signed by
him, almost, that came to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether Dr. Hartogs actually interviewed these
children and talked to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Or did he just administer the work of other psychiatrists, do you
know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. I don't know if he had, you know, colleagues who did the work for
him. As a matter of fact, I don't know how many times he saw Lee or his
mother. All we used to get is a report signed by Dr. Hartogs. I don't know
if he personally saw this boy or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What else can you remember of your contacts with Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Let me tell you my recollection of the Oswald case. As you can
imagine, from 13 years ago, this was an odd thing, because I did not realize that
Oswald was the person that had killed Kennedy the first couple of days. It was
only almost&mdash;I believe it was after the burial or just about that time, while I
was watching the papers, on the day that he actually was killed by Ruby,
that I saw some pictures of the mother, and I started reading about the New
York situation, that it suddenly tied in, because, you know, something happening
in Texas, 1,500 miles, is something you hardly associate with a youngster
that you had 10 years prior or 12 years prior.</p>

<p>A friend of mine called me up, a social worker, to tell me, "Carro, you know
who that case is?"</p>

<p>And he said, "That was the case you handled. Don't you remember?"</p>

<p>And then we started discussing the case, and I remembered then, and what
happened then is I felt, you know, it was a kind of a numb feeling, because you
know about it and could not know what to do with it. I was a probation officer
and despite the fact that I was no longer one, I still felt that this was a kind
of a ticklish situation, about something that I knew that no one else knew, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
I went upstairs and I told the press secretary to the mayor. I told him the information
that had just been relayed to me that I had been Oswald's P.O. and
that I should tell the mayor about it, and the mayor had gone to Washington, so
he told me, "Just sit tight and don't say anything."</p>

<p>The story didn't break in the papers&mdash;this was on a Tuesday or Wednesday&mdash;until
Saturday when someone found out, went to Judge Kelley, and then there
were stories Friday, Saturday, and the Post reporter showed up to my house on a
Sunday evening. I don't know how he found out where I lived or anything else,
but once he got there, I called city hall again, "Look, I got this reporter over here.
What do I do with him?"</p>

<p>They said, "So apparently the story has broken. So talk to him." But the reporter
it seemed, had more information than I had. He was actually clarifying
my mind, because you can understand that you're not going to quote, you know,
paraphrase 13 years later what happened. I have worked with a great many
children during that time, and I have done a great deal of work with youth. What
did stand out, you know, that I really recall as a recollection of my own was this
fact, that this was a small boy. Most of the boys that I had on probation were
Puerto Rican or Negro, and they were New York type of youngsters who spoke in
the same slang, who came from the Bronx whom I knew how to relate to because
I knew the areas where they came from, and this boy was different only in two or
three respects. One, that I was a Catholic probation officer and this boy was a
Lutheran, which was strange to begin with, because you normally carry youth of
your own background. And secondly that he did dress in a western style with the
levis, and he spoke with this southwestern accent which made him different from
the average boy that I had on probation.</p>

<p>And, as I said, my own reaction then was that he seemed like a likable boy
who did not seem mentally retarded or anything. He seemed fairly bright,
and once spoken to, asked anything, he replied. He was somewhat guarded,
but he did reply, and my own reaction in speaking to him was one of concern,
because he did not want to play with anybody, he did not care to go to school;
he said he wasn't really learning anything; he had brothers, but he didn't miss
them or anything. He seems to have liked his stay at Youth House, and this
is not&mdash;how do you call it&mdash;not odd, because in Youth House they did show the
movies and give candy bars and this and the other, and they were paid attention,
and this is a boy who is virtually alone all day, and only in that respect
did it mean anything to me.</p>

<p>As I told reporters at the time there was no indicia that this boy had any
Marxist leanings or that he had any tendencies at that age that I was able to
view that would lead him into future difficulty.</p>

<p>Actually he came before the court with no prior record, with just the fact that
he was not going to school, and the other thing that touched me was that
the mother at that time seemed overprotective; she just seemed to think
that there was nothing wrong with the boy, and that once we got him back
to school, which I told him in no uncertain terms he would have to go back
because he was just too young to decide he would not go to school any more,
that all his problems were resolved. I think it may have been a threat to
her to want to involve her in the treatment for the boy, because I did make a
recommendation that he&mdash;it seemed to me that he needed help, that he needed
to relate to some adult, that he needed to be brought out of this kind of a
shell that he was retreating to, and not wanting friends, not wanting to go
out, and not wanting to relate to anyone, and that I thought he had the capacity
for doing this, and the psychiatric report sort of bore this out in perhaps much
more medical terms, and they recommended that he either receive this kind of
a support of therapeutic group work treatment at home, if it were possible, or,
if not, in an institution.</p>

<p>Now, the situation in this kind of case is that treatment has to involve the
parent, you know, the whole family setup, not just the child, and I think this
is where the mother sort of felt threatened herself. People do not always
understand what group work and treatment and psychiatric treatment means.
There are all kinds of connotations to it, and she resisted this.</p>

<p>We tried&mdash;or even before we came into the case, before the case came to
court, I think she had been referred to the Salvation Army, I believe it was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
and she had not responded. Actually, when the boy came back with all these
reports to the court, he was not put on supervision per se to me. The matter
was sort of up in the air where it would be brought back every month while
we made referral to various agencies, to see if they would take him into Children's
Village or Harriman Farms, and whatever it was, and it was just
looking around, shopping around for placement for him. And the mother, I
think, felt threatened about that time, that the boy was back in school, we
were looking to get him psychiatric treatment, and she came in and wanted
to take the boy out of the State, and we told her she could not take him out
without the court's OK.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I recall the case was put on the calendar before Judge
Sicher in November of that year, 1953, when she was told, yes, that it was
necessary to have the boy remain here, and that that is when the judge
ordered a referral to the psychiatric clinic of the court, and to the Big Brothers
who subsequently accepted the boy for working with. With that the mother took
off in January, without letting us know, and just never came back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have the impression that Mrs. Oswald had the idea
that you were going to take the boy and place him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. I think she might have had the idea because we certainly were
coming back to court each month, you know, with the judge saying, "Well, try
Children's Village. Try Harriman Farms, try this place and try that."</p>

<p>I think she was threatened, that there was a plan afoot, that if the boy would
not work out, that he would be placed. This was one of the recommendations
that I felt he should be placed, and the court also; something could be worked
out, because, incidentally, when he did go back to school he did go to school,
but he was presenting, you know, marginal problems in school, and he was not
doing as well as expected.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There is a summary report in the file that he had been elected
president of his class; that the court had been given a report to that effect.
Do you recall anything about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. No. As a matter of fact, the one that I recall is that he neglected
to salute the American flag in class, and the reason I never said anything of
that to the newspapers is because I figured they would pick this up and say,
you know, "See, 15 years ago he refused to salute the American flag. This is
proof." And I did not want a newspaper headline, you know, "Oswald at the
age of 12 refused to salute the American flag."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That happens from time to time, I suppose, in children that
age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. The kind of reports that came back, he was a little disruptive in
class, but nothing of any nature that I would, you know, singly point out.
He did not become president of the class that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You indicated that you had the feeling that the possibility of
Lee Oswald being involved with psychiatric treatment, which would also involve
his mother, whole family group, constituted a threat to or threatened the
mother. What did you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Well, there was a reluctance in her to get involved in the boy's
treatment process. She saw herself as removed, as this having nothing to do
with her. Furthermore, she saw the boy's problem as the only problem being
he did not go to school, and once we insisted that he go back to school her
attitude was, "Why are you bothering me? You're harassing me. He's back
in school. Why do you want him to go to the clinic for? Why should I go with
him? Why do we have to see the Protestant Big Brothers for? He has
brothers. What does he need brothers for? Leave us alone. I don't like
New York. I was a woman of means in Louisiana when my husband was alive."</p>

<p>Here in New York she just felt that people were&mdash;this was just bothering her;
she couldn't understand that in helping the boy you need to have the help of the
parent because this is a young boy, and if he is going to go to a court clinic, for
example, she has to take him there, and her own attitude toward the help he is
receiving, unless it is one that will support whatever we are trying to do for him,
if it is negative, and she is rejecting, and she is resisting, the boy himself will
resist whatever kind involvement you are doing for him, and we needed her to see
this, and did go along with the plan. Or she may have been as disturbed as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
boy but we were just trying to get her involved in whatever plan we had for the
boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I wanted to seek your opinion on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. I think she was. Even at that time I said that she was so self-involved
in her own situation that she tended to blame everything, and yet say
it was nothing, for the boy's problems. The fact that a boy could stay out of
school, I think it was 47 days before he went to this new school and not report
at all, and have a parent whom the attendance officer and the bureau of education,
bureau of attendance is getting after, and the parent admits that she
cannot control or cannot do anything about her boy not going to school, is
significant of her inability to cope with this situation.</p>

<p>Then this plus, this idea&mdash;I don't know if she, in fact, came from wealth or
not; this giving you this idea that where she came from she was a woman of
means and all that, but in New York here, she had been downgraded to this
kind of a thing. She mentioned that part of his problem was that when he
first came to live here in the Bronx, they lived around the Grand Concourse,
and I don't know if you are familiar with the Bronx, but Grand Concourse is
an area of fairly middle class Jewish community, and she felt this, that the
boy was dressed in a little below the level of the children up there. He did
dress in levis and I think his reaction in not going to school was in part the
fact that some of the children had poked fun both at his dress and his
manner of speech, and he had retreated from this, and this is why he
would not mix and why he became a loner, and she reacted in the same way,
and she was working, as I think I recall it, in a department store, and she was
very unhappy about the whole situation, and she was really in no position to
be with this boy any length of time, and she seemed so preoccupied with her
own problems at the time that I do not think she really had an awareness as
to the boy's own problem and fears.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you get the feeling that Mrs. Oswald felt that if&mdash;I can
say this because I have lived in New York for the last 7 years myself, so it
doesn't bother me too much to bring it out. I am really a New Yorker. Did
she have the feeling, do you think, that if these nosey New Yorkers would just
leave her alone and keep out of her business everything would be all right?
In other words, it was just a kind of situation that exists here in this city
because of the nature of the city that was different from the way things were
in Texas, maybe, or Louisiana, that this <span class="locked">had&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. I don't have any doubt about it. I think she must have thought
that we were making a mountain out of a molehill, and that in some other
States&mdash;I was brought up in Puerto Rico, myself; if a boy didn't go to school
or so nobody saw to it that he was brought to court, that he was sent to a
psychiatrist, that the Big Brothers got involved in it, that you referred him here
and there, and this is why I said she must have been threatened by this whole
process; there is no question about it in my mind, that she could not see what
all this fuss was all about. She said so, too. No question in my mind about
that. I am sure that this had an effect on her decision to leave the State and
take off, and particularly when she came to see us and we told her she could
not go without the OK of the court, that the boy was under the supervision
of the court, and he would have to remain so until the court felt that it was OK.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She did advise you, however, before leaving the State, that she
did intend to leave the State of New York, did she not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Well, she advised my colleague, Timothy Dunn, I was on vacation
I think that month of January, she came in to see him, she was referred by the
Big Brothers, who told her she could not leave without coming to see us, and
she came in to tell him, and he told her before she did we would have to put the
matter on the calendar and that it would be up to the judge.</p>

<p>You see, normally it is not that we don't allow it, that we prohibit it. Routinely,
even if a boy is under supervision or probation, what you do is, if the
parent comes in, you put it on the calendar, you go up and report to the judge,
and the judge will ask the parent, or you will have the information, and the
parent wants to go to Newark, N.J., or, you know, Louisiana, that they are
going to live with such-and-such a person over there and the court may ask
you to write to that jurisdiction, to go out and make a visit to that home to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
if it is a worthwhile home, and to see if there is a realistic plan or just not an
effort on the part of the parents to take the boy out of the jurisdiction of the
court, and you know if such a plan in reality exists and how feasible and how
good is it in the interests of the welfare of the child, because for all the court
may know, this is just a fiction on the part of the person to say, "I am moving
out to Philadelphia," and they may not be moving at all. You go up to the court,
get the child discharged, and they just remain where they are. And this way the
boy doesn't have to report to the court any more and the parent doesn't have to
bother herself with this sort of thing.</p>

<p>So she came in to tell us, and she was told that the matter would have to
be put on the calendar and that the judge would have to pass on this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But despite that fact she left the jurisdiction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. I wrote to her to come in, having heard, and the letter was returned
"Moved, address unknown." I was asked about what happens then, and, well,
there is very little that one can really do. We don't have extra-state jurisdiction,
and we didn't even know where she had gone. This is about the sum total of
what happened there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you yourself try to find a place to place this boy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Yes; from the very time that we had the recommendations of the
psychiatrist, those that I had made were before the judge, and he went along
and felt that this boy should be helped, and the next almost 9 months I spent
in making referral after referral to the various institutions, the various clinics,
to see if they would be able to service this boy either at home or within the
institutional confines, because the psychiatric report was very distinctive in the
fact that this boy did need this kind of help; and I mentioned that the tragedy
of the whole thing was in this instance that because of his tender age and his
religion, the facilities that we had here in New York were taxed, and somehow
one factor or the other kept us from getting him the kind of help that he needed.
It was either that it was a Protestant place and he was&mdash;well, he was a Lutheran,
it was either a Catholic and he was a Lutheran, or one thing or another, but
something mitigated their being able to service him.</p>

<p>I remember, for example, that the Salvation Army got a referral, and they
felt they just didn't have the facility to give this boy the intensive treatment
he needed. This was their reason for turning him down.</p>

<p>Children's village at the time, which could have given service to this boy and
had the kind of setup, did not have any vacancies at this particular time of the
year for this particular age boy; and so on down the line. Finally, the only recourse
we had was to send it to our own psychiatric clinic, where we would do
both, have him seen by a psychiatrist at our clinic, which normally we didn't
even do, and at the same time receive the support of help from the Big Brothers,
which was one of the recommendations that he should be seen by a male figure
preferably because of the fact that he lacked a father, and we were actually
complementing both without removing the boy from the home, and this is actually
when the mother left. So that the boy was not going to be taken away;
we were going to try to work out within, you know, the limits of the situation we
had with the boy at home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned that the boy was going to go to your own psychiatric
clinic. That is a different proposition from the Youth House, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Yes. This is the psychiatric court clinic, that is on 22d Street,
which in some instances, where we are not able to effect the kind of placing we
need or so, we will utilize that as a last resort, and the boy would go there
periodically and be seen by the psychiatrist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It would be an outpatient-type situation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. An outpatient-type of situation, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He never actually did do that, however, because he left the
State?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. No; because of the mother's own resistance to the thing and having
left the jurisdiction. I don't think they got to see him once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you say that Oswald was more mentally disturbed than
most of the boys that you had under your supervision at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Not at all, actually. I have handled cases of boys who committed
murders, burglaries, and I have had some extremely disturbed boys, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
this was one of the problems, this was just initially a truancy situation, not
one of real disruptive or acting out delinquent behavior. No; I would definitely
not put him among those who acted as&mdash;I also have had boys whom we have
placed who turned out to be mentally defective, mentally retarded, quite psychotic,
and who really had gradations of mental illness, of disturbances that
were far, you know, greater in depth than those displayed by Oswald; and the
behavior which brought them before the court was certainly of a much more
extreme nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Than his?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He did not in fact appear to you at that time to be a real
mental problem or prone to violence <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. No. He appeared to have problems, but one of the problems in
the situation seems to be, why wasn't this boy sent to the New York Training
School for Boys at Warwick? And the fact is that the New York Training
School for Boys at Warwick is for delinquent boys who commit crimes, really,
and whose behavior is such that it is really criminal behavior; and you brand it
delinquency because of the tag that attaches because he is under 16. You don't
normally send a boy who just stays out of school. It is for boys who commit
serious acts. And as a matter of fact, Warwick did not have what this boy
needed: extensive psychiatric help. And that is why he was not sent to the
only school we have in the city, which is Warwick, for the more serious boy.
More seriously, it is even a drastic action to place a boy away who comes in for
truancy, because truancy is itself a passive delinquent act. It is not an act
which vitiates against society or mores or does harm to other people. It is an
act of omission, a failure to go to school rather than an aggressive acting out,
where you are destroying property or injurying persons or other things. And
this is one of the factors in here.</p>

<p>It was surprising in this instance that we wanted placement and the reason
we felt placement was needed in this instance was because although you may
get boys acting out in other areas, there is always someone in the community
who can help out, and the court will hesitate to put a boy away if some plan
can be formulated within, because the court in social work feels that there is no
substitute for love and parents, even in the best of institutions that you can place
children.</p>

<p>But here the boy had no parents; he had no father; he wasn't going to school;
he had no friends; he had&mdash;no agency was working with the family. He was
on his own. He was just watching television all day. He wasn't mixing with
anybody. He was an extremely introverted young man. He didn't want to go to
school. So that in effect he had nothing going for him outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And in addition to all that, that his mother didn't show any
inclination to cooperate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. She was ineffectual. She didn't want to cooperate and there
was nothing that I as a probation officer could hang my hat on to say, "Keep
him here in New York City. The mother will see him through, between his
mother and I, this agency and I." There was nothing there out of the total
community that would be a prop or a crutch to help him see these things through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And it was these reasons that prompted you to recommend
placement rather than a peculiar extreme mental disturbance in the boy
himself, you would say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Yes; it was just the sum total of the environmental factors
rather than the boy's own inward manifestations of mental disturbance or
psychotic disorder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned before that his particular type of truancy was
different from the kind of truancy that you many times run into where the
kids will just take off and go fishing or just go <span class="locked">out&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Fly kites or pigeons, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think it was different because Oswald just had a
tendency to stay home and watch television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. <span class="locked">No&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Wait, <span class="locked">please&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. I am sorry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Or did you think that the fact that he had this different kind
of truancy was a reflection of some sort of mental disturbance on Oswald's
part, or would you say that it was just as much a function of environment, the
environment that he found himself in here in New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Well, I don't think there is any question in my mind that there
was an inability to adapt, to adapt from the change of environment. One of the
things that probably influenced me in this is that I came to New York City when I
was 9 years of age and when I came here I didn't speak a word of English,
and I lived in what we call East Harlem, in an area where there was a Puerto
Rican community within a Negro area, and I recall when I went to school
there were four Puerto Rican boys in a class that was otherwise all Negro,
and I used to virtually run home every day in the first 2 months I lived in
the city, because at one point or another the Negro boys would be waiting for
me outside to take my pencils, my money, and anything that I had in my hands.</p>

<p>I remember my mother bought me a pair of skates and I don't think I was
downstairs for 10 minutes with the skates&mdash;I don't think I was down there for
10 minutes before they took them away from me. And I just stayed upstairs
and waited for my mother at 5 o'clock.</p>

<p>Then eventually I made friends with the other three boys, and when somebody
took my books, one of the other boys stayed with me, and I fought with the
Negro boys until things worked out&mdash;and, as I remember, things didn't work
out. I had to transfer to another school.</p>

<p>But I can see this kind of reaction taking place. You meet the situations.
Either you meet them head on or you retreat from them.</p>

<p>Now he apparently had one or two incidents where he was taunted over his
inability to speak the same way that the kids up here speak and to dress the
same way or even comb his hair&mdash;you know, here the kids wore pegged pants
and they talked in their own ditty-bop fashion. There is no&mdash;that this kid
was a stranger to them in mores, culture and everything else, and apparently
he could not make that adaptation, and he felt that they didn't want any
part of him and he didn't want any part of them, and he seemed self-sufficient
enough at the time that I recall that I asked him. He felt he wasn't learning
anything in school and that he had other, more important things to learn and do.</p>

<p>Now, whether this was an artifice on his part, you know, a mechanism, I don't
know&mdash;but it didn't&mdash;let me say it didn't trigger any reaction on my part that
this was symptomatic of a deeper emotional disturbance. I thought that this
was just symptomatic of a boy who had chosen one way of reacting to a situation
that other boys would react to in another fashion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I understand that some statements have been made, based apparently
on the psychiatric reports or the observations of people who worked
with Lee Oswald here in New York when he was 13 years old, to the effect
that one might have been able to predict, from seeing the boy at that time, that
he might well commit an act such as the assassination, or some similar violent
act. Did you see any such indication in Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. No; naturally I didn't see it, and I would say that would be
extremely difficult in order to be able to make that sort of projection or prediction.
I have even, when I worked with the Youth Board as a streetclub
worker, I worked in the street where we had no psychiatrists along with us
and where we worked with much more psychotic and deeply disturbed boys,
who did kill somebody right along the line, possibly a couple of months later,
and even though, you know, the studies we have done here in the city and
everything shows that there are a great many people who are extremely disturbed
walking around, and the crutch that just keeps them on their marginal&mdash;what
do you call&mdash;on this marginal living, where they just don't go out and
commit some violent act, that you don't know what it is, what the factors are
that keep them from just blowing up or exploding altogether.</p>

<p>I didn't see any particular behavior that would say that this boy would
someday commit this act. I have seen it, let's say, in the Puerto Rican youth I
am familiar with, the Negro youth, that sometimes they ascribe this to a crying
out of people to say that they exist and that they are human beings, and they
commit that violent act, just to get their one day in the sun, the day when all
the papers will focus on them, and say, "I am me. I am alive."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
I worked with this young man in the case of the killing, this Raymond Serra,
and this fellow, after blowing this boy's jaw up, he was flashing the victory
sign like this [indicating], and when we visited him in jail he said, "Did you
see my picture in the papers?" And the paper played this up as a coldblooded
killer. And they don't realize that 2 days later, sensibility dawns on him, and
these are the weakest, the most remorseful kids. This is just the bravado at
the moment. And this is their one point in life where they draw everybody's
attention&mdash;most of these kids in private life come from broken homes, and
they take this opportunity to show that they are human beings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you suggesting that this is one of the factors that motivated
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Well, I am saying that this is a young man who apparently was
trying to find himself and really had been&mdash;you know, he had been knocking
about a great deal from here to Russia and everywhere, and he had come back
disgruntled, and nobody paid any attention to him. Some people are prone
to this.</p>

<p>I wouldn't speculate on what drove Oswald to do this. I would say in my
experience I have encountered many a boy who will do things like this to
attract attention to themselves, that they exist, and they want somebody to
care for them. It is hard to say what motivated him. I don't really know. I
had no inkling of that at that stage.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he said when he grew up he wanted to go into the Service,
just like his brothers, who were in the Service, and he said he liked to horseback
ride; he used to collect stamps. But certainly these things that he said were
the normal kind of outlet, the things any normal boy of 13 years of age would do.
There was nothing that would lead me to believe when I saw him at the age of
12 that there would be seeds of destruction for somebody. I couldn't in all
honesty sincerely say such a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let me ask this, Mr. Carro: After you became aware of the
fact, after it was called to your attention that Lee Oswald had been under your
supervision as a probation officer, did you have occasion to review the records
of the case before <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. No; I had no&mdash;there was nothing to review. Those kind of records
were all kept in the children's court. The only recollection&mdash;and they were not
furnished to me. The newspaper guy who came to see me seemed to have gotten,
as I mentioned&mdash;there were five reports made, and they are sent out to different
institutions. I don't know. I am not privy to how newspapermen get their
information, but he seemed to have a better knowledge. He was just in a
sense corroborating what I may have said at a particular point and all that,
with me, and I had nothing to really go on, you know, that would refresh my
recollection, except this conversation with this social worker, a friend of mine,
who knew of the case, because they had gotten it from me, who called me to
say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that you yourself have not actually <span class="locked">reviewed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. I have no independent record of any sort or had nothing to refresh
my recollection about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you had not seen the court's papers or the petition that
was filed, or the <span class="locked">memorandum&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. No; the only thing that I might have seen, and I don't&mdash;an FBI
agent come in and spoke to me a couple of months ago, and I don't know if
that was the original record he had with him, but he sat down, as you are,
and spoke to me, and there was little I could add to what was in the record
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The record that you <span class="locked">prepared&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Well, I noticed it was my handwriting. He seemed to have my
record with him. I had no independent recollection or evidence outside of the
records he had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The records which you would have prepared would be prepared
by you in the course of your work as a probation officer, and they would
have reflected your opinions at that time, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Correct, and I would have nothing to add now at this point as to
what happened 12 years ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let me ask you to review a photostatic copy of a document that
is captioned "Supplementary Facts and Explanations," which appears to be
some sort of exhibit to a petition in connection with Lee Oswald. This particular
document I refer to consists of eight pages and I would ask you to review
that briefly, to look it over and tell me if you recognize what it is, where this
gets into the proceedings and if it in fact sets forth the report of some of your
work, reports to the Youth House, and would it be the record that was prepared
at that time in connection with the court proceedings relating to Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Yes; as I just briefly peruse over it, first of all, it is the form that
is prescribed by the court for making a report by the judge, that you can readily
notice it has a prescribed type of form where you begin with the identifying
information as to the child, the nature of the petition, the initial court actions,
and then you go into the actual history as to the family, previous court record,
family history, and then you have paragraphs set off for the home and neighborhood,
school record, religious affiliations, activities and special interests, mental
and physical condition, child's version, which is the discussion with the child
as to the nature of the incidence why he was before the court, parental attitudes,
where you discuss with the parents; past records with other agencies and
evaluation of the recommendation which is made by the probation officer based
on his getting together all this data.</p>

<p>And you will also notice that included then beyond that report, which is
signed by the probation officer, includes the summary for the probation officer,
which is a summary of the psychiatric study, not the actual study.</p>

<p>And then this is a record of the various court actions which preceded, who
appeared, when, and I note that my signature&mdash;not my signature but my name
has been typed in with respect to the various actions that took place subsequent
to the boy being returned to the court during the time he was under the supervision
of the court, right up to January 1954.</p>

<p>Just perusing over this, I know that this is the various reports that I made
to the court.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And it finally concludes with your <span class="locked">statement&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Yes; concluding with the last statement of the court action of
March 11, 1954, before Justice Delaney, where there was no appearance by
the people; it was just the attendance officer, myself, the probation officer, before
the court, and that Mrs. Barnes reported that she had contacted New Orleans
and received no information as to the whereabouts of the family, and there was
a question that a former associate thought that the family may have been
living in California.</p>

<p>Justice Delaney discharged the case and Lee was no longer in our jurisdiction,
which goes along with the fact that we had no idea; we attempted to find out;
we wrote to Louisiana and New Orleans but couldn't get back any positive
reports.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would this particular document, which I will mark as "Exhibit
1" on the deposition of Mr. John Carro, April 16, 1964, at New York&mdash;would
that have been attached to the petition or just a part of the record as a special
report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. No; this would be part of the court record, and actually the
petition is just one petition where the judges make their own small notations
when the probation officer appears. And that is the docket. That is kept up
in the courtroom in their files. These are the records&mdash;this is the actual record
that is kept by the probation department, and the only thing that is sent to
the other agencies is just this initial report. You don't send in the day-to-day
or the month-to-month, other subsequent actions. So that this is a separate
report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would this record in the ordinary course reflect all of the action
taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Yes; this is the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In connection with the case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. This is the record that the probation officer maintains while the
case is under his supervision until the case is closed and reflects the contacts
with the child, periodic or&mdash;all the contacts and any work that the probation
officer does he is supposed to report here and make a small notation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Carro, I have initialed Exhibit 1 on your deposition for
purposes of identification, and I ask you if you would also initial it near my
initials so that we won't have any difficulty in identifying it. I am correct in
my understanding, am I not, that you prepared this report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Yes; this is my report and the entries herein, except for one or
two that may have been made by Mr. Dunn&mdash;and I refer to the entry of 1-5-54,
while I was on vacation&mdash;those bearing the name John Carro, bearing my name,
are my entries, and this is my report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let the record show that the exhibit that we have marked is a
somewhat illegible copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As you have indicated to me, the original was on yellow paper,
which does not reproduce well. I will obtain the original and make it a part of
the record. Can you think of anything else, Mr. Carro, about Oswald or your
contacts with Oswald that you think would be of help to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Well, I think that there has been so much written on it that you
have probably a much more comprehensive report, since you have been able
to get the actual records of these statements that I made at the time I wrote
this. I doubt that I could really say anything at this point, 12 years later or so,
that would be of any help to you.</p>

<p>Whatever I might say would just be an independent opinion on my own and
I don't think that would be that valid. I think you have the original psychiatric
report here, the social agency report, and whatever it is, and they are amply&mdash;I
don't think that I could add anything independently that would be of help
to the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In view of that, Mr. Carro, I don't have any more questions.
I want to thank you very much on behalf of the Commission for coming here
and for giving the testimony that you have. It is another example of the way
the city of New York and the people who are associated with it have cooperated
with the work of the Commission. The Commission appreciates it very much.
We thank you sincerely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. I appreciate very much your having me over here. I would like
to offer whatever help I can, and I hope I have been of some help in making
whatever decision you have to make on this matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have been very helpful, Mr. Carro.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carro</span>. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="t214"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_RENATUS_HARTOGS" id="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_RENATUS_HARTOGS">TESTIMONY OF DR. RENATUS HARTOGS</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Dr. Renatus Hartogs was taken at 5:20 p.m., on April 16,
1964, at 7 East 86th Street, New York, N.Y., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Renatus Hartogs, having been first duly sworn, was examined and testified
as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am a member of the legal
staff of the President's Commission investigating the assassination of President
Kennedy. Staff members have been authorized to take the testimony of witnesses
by the Commission pursuant to authority granted to the Commission by
Executive Order No. 1130, dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution of
Congress No. 137.</p>

<p>The Commission has also adopted certain rules of procedure governing the
taking of testimony of witnesses which provide, among other things, that each
witness should receive a copy of the Executive order and the joint resolution
to which I have just referred, as well as a copy of the rules governing the taking
of testimony. The Commission will provide you with copies of these documents.</p>

<p>The rules concerning the taking of testimony provide generally that a witness
may have counsel if he wishes. He is entitled to 3 days' notice, which I do
not believe you had, but every witness is also entitled to waive that notice. I
presume that you will waive the notice since we are here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. That's right, sure, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We want to inquire of you concerning the contact which the
Commission understands you had with Lee Harvey Oswald some time in 1953
or 1954.</p>

<p>Would you state your full name for the record, please.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Renatus Hartogs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your address?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. 7 East 86th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where were you born and when?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. In Mainz, M-a-i-n-z, Germany, January 22, 1909.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you come to the United States, Doctor?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. On December 4, 1940.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You received your education in Germany, is that correct?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. In Germany, in Belgium. I have a Ph. D. from the University
of Frankfurt-am-Main, which is Germany, and I have a medical degree from the
University of Brussels Medical School, and then I came to the United States
and I studied medicine again to fulfill the requirements of the New York
State Education Department, and I have a medical degree from the University
of Montreal Medical School. Then I have an M.A. from New York University,
and that's it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In what field is that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. In clinical psychopathology.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you <span class="locked">are&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. I am a Ph. D. in clinical psychology and an M.D.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are admitted to the practice of medicine in the State of
New York, is that correct?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. In the State of New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you have taken the examination for the practice of
medicine?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you are admitted to practice medicine in the State?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are regularly engaged, are you not, in the practice of
medicine as a psychiatrist?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. As a psychiatrist exclusively, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long have you been practicing here in the United States
as a psychiatrist?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. In the States since 1949.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you practice medicine in Germany?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. In Belgium.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long did you practice in Belgium?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that as a psychiatrist or in the general practice of
medicine?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No, psychologist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are also the chief psychiatrist for the Youth House of
New York City, is that correct?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long have you held that position?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Since 1951.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What kind of duties do you perform as the chief psychiatrist
at the Youth House? Tell us generally about what they are.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes, that's right. I examine all the children which have been
remanded to Youth House on order of the court for the purpose of psychiatric
examination, so not all children who are at Youth House are psychiatrically
examined. There is only a specific quantity, number. As these children are
psychiatrically examined by me and my staff, I submit my report to the court
with recommendations and diagnosis, and it is up to the court to follow the
recommendations or not.</p>

<p>I at the same time teach the staff. I give workshops in the psychiatric
aspects of social work. I give seminars in which we discuss very interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
cases which have come up and to which the professional public of New York
City is invited.</p>

<p>So, for instance, we gave such a seminar on Oswald. That is the reason
why I vaguely remember him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were also, as you have testified, the chief psychiatrist
for the Youth House in 1953.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were your duties in connection with that job pretty much the
same in 1953 as they are now?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How large a staff did you have in 1953, approximately?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Approximately I would say 300.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. A staff?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes, staff, because we have three shifts, you see. We have
about two staff members for every child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I see. I thought you testified previously that there were other
psychiatrists.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Oh, my staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes, on your staff, not at the Youth House, but on your staff.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Oh, I thought&mdash;on my staff we have three psychiatrists now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. About how many did you have in 1953?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. In 1953 we had two, two or three. It changed continuously.
Sometimes we had even four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember the names of the other psychiatrists who
were on the staff at the time Oswald was in the Youth House?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No, no. They are continuously changing. Sometimes they
were just for a few weeks there, but I have remained on the staff continuously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Youth House is an institution of the city of New York, is
that correct, or is it supported by voluntary contributions? Is it a private institution
or is it an adjunct of the city of New York?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Right now it is part of the probation department of the city
of New York, under the jurisdiction of the probation department. Previously
it was a private institution with a private board. Then later on the city of
New York took over as far as the administration and the payment of the salaries
is concerned, but the private board was maintained. So today the private
board still exists, but the probation department of the city of New York has
the jurisdiction over Youth House.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Does the city of New York support it financially?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes, the city of New York pays for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that true, do you know, offhand, in 1953, or was it still
a private organization at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. At that time it was a private organization, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are a citizen of the United States, are you not?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes, since 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you outline for us in general terms what the procedure
is with respect to a boy who is remanded to the Youth House for psychiatric
observation. He is ordered by the court to go to the Youth House; he goes
to the Youth House.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. He goes to the Youth House, that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What generally happens to him then?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. When he is in Youth House he is given a preliminary screening
as to what kind of a person he is, through human figure drawings. That is a
special test that is given.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who administers that, social workers on the staff?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Social workers, and the psychologists, they do that, a preliminary
screening, because if we have very disturbed children right away from
the beginning we&mdash;I see them right away on an emergency basis and send them
out because we cannot keep too disturbed children in Youth House. We send
them then to a mental hospital. So then this child goes into an intake dormitory
where he is dressed, acquainted with the techniques of adjustment in Youth
House, the Youth House philosophy. Then he is assigned to one of the dormitories,
and then he is sent to school. We have our own school, P.S. 613. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
have our own workshops for the children, recreation department. We have
group service. We have our own hospital where the child is checked as to
his physical health.</p>

<p>So the child is slowly but surely introduced in all these various departments.</p>

<p>Then the social worker has interviews with this child and with the parents
of the child who are invited.</p>

<p>Then the school authorities prepare a report for me so that when I see the
child I have in front of me the probation officer's report, the social worker's
report on his contact with the child and the parents, I have the report of group
service or household, as it is called, I have the report of the medical department,
and I have the report of the recreation department, and I have also the report
of the psychologist.</p>

<p>And then I see the child and examine the child, and then I incorporate in my
report all these, my own findings with the findings of the Youth House staff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us approximately in 1953 how much of your time
you devoted to the examination of children in Youth House?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. 30 hours per week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. 30 hours a week. And about how many children would you
see during the period of time in a week, average week?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. During that, 10 or 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that you would spend somewhere between 2 and 3 hours with
each child, is that correct?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that still true?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No, I mean not with the child itself. The child is seen for about
half an hour to an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. By you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. By me, but then I have also to study the record which takes
half an hour, and then it takes about an hour to dictate, so that counts about
2 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In your capacity as chief psychiatrist for the Youth House did
you have occasion at any time to interview Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us when that was and all that you can remember
about that interview in your own words.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. That is tough. I remember that&mdash;actually I reconstructed this
from what I remembered from the seminar. We gave a seminar on this boy
in which we discussed him, because he came to us on a charge of truancy from
school, and yet when I examined him, I found him to have definite traits of
dangerousness. In other words, this child had a potential for explosive, aggressive,
assaultive acting out which was rather unusual to find in a child who
was sent to Youth House on such a mild charge as truancy from school.</p>

<p>This is the reason why I remember this particular child, and that is the reason
why we discussed him in the seminar.</p>

<p>I found him to be a medium-sized, slender, curlyhaired youngster, pale-faced,
who was not very talkative, he was not spontaneous. He had to be prompted.
He was polite. He answered in a somewhat monotonous fashion. His sentences
were well structured. He was in full contact with reality.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He was?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. He was in full contact with reality. I found his reasoning
to be intensely self-centered, his judgment also centering around his own needs,
and the way he looked at life and his relationships with people. This was
mostly in the foreground. So this is what I remember actually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say that you have reconstructed your recollection of your
interview with Lee Oswald by thinking of the seminar that you gave; is that
correct?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. The seminar; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any independent recollection of the interview
with Lee Oswald itself?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Only from remembering the seminar, what kind of a boy he was
and what I said at that time, I was able to reconstruct the picture of the boy
as I just described it; yes. That is how I proceeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us about the seminar, Doctor. How did it come that you
gave this seminar on Oswald, to whom was it given, what was the general
subject matter of the seminar?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes; every Monday afternoon, at 1:30 until 3 o'clock, the professional
Youth House staff gets together in order to discuss an interesting or
unusual child. At that time we selected Oswald because of the reason which I
indicated, the discrepancy between the charge and the seriousness of his personality
disturbance, and the seminar was opened by the Youth House director;
then the social worker talked about the development, background and early
history of the child; then the Youth House recreation department and household
talked, and then the school department gave a report; then the psychologist
reported on his findings, and then I acquainted the people who were present
with the findings of the psychiatrist and recommendations which I made to
the court.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Whose suggestion was it that Oswald be used as a subject
matter for the seminar?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. I believe it was mine, because I was the one to select these
children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any report of the proceedings of the seminar
prepared?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No; it is all spontaneous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Just a spontaneous, informal sort of thing?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. No one made any memorandum of what occurred at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any records relating to the seminar?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No; there are never any records, never anything written down;
it is purely informal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The only writings that would have been at the seminar would
have been the reports that had been previously prepared by you and by the other
members of the Youth House staff; is that correct?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recall what recommendation you made to the court in
respect of Oswald?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. If I can recall correctly, I recommended that this youngster
should be committed to an institution.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What type of institution, do you recall?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No; that I don't recall. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you are quite clear in your recollection that you recommended
that he be institutionalized immediately because of the personality
pattern disturbance; is that correct?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes; that is right. That I remember; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long did Oswald stay at the Youth House, do you know?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Not exactly. Not exactly. Anything from 4 to 8 weeks, that
is the average stay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Youth House is a place the basic function of which is
observation of children in a controlled environment; would you say?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Controlled environment for the purpose of psychiatric observation
or for the purpose of detention pending court appearance, or custodial care
of the child pending his commitment, I mean his actual transfer to a child-caring
or custodial institution such as a training school. These are the three
purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Youth House is not the kind of place where a boy would
be kept indefinitely after he had been committed, or something like that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No, the average is about 2 to 3 months; I mean 3 months is
maximum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you recall what kind of institution you recommended that
Oswald be committed to?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. I never make a recommendation as to the name, the specific
institution. This is a prerogative of the court.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you make a recommendation as to the type of institution
to which you recommend a child?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes; I do that, either a mental hospital or training school or
residential treatment center, but I do not recall in this case what I recommended.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you do recall quite clearly that you did recommend, because
of this boy's personality pattern, disturbance?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes; that he should not be placed in the community.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Or placed on probation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recall being interviewed on this question by the FBI?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember approximately when they interviewed you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No; I don't know the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember that you told them the same thing, that is,
that you recommended institutionalizing Oswald as a result of his psychiatric
examination which indicated that he was potentially dangerous?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us how you first became aware, after the assassination,
that Lee Oswald was a child with whom you had had previous
contact?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. The first time was, I read it in the newspaper, Justice Kelley,
you know, Florence Kelley, made a statement to the press that Oswald had
been in the Youth House, and she revealed details of the psychiatric report
which immediately made me aware of the fact that I was the one to examine
the child, because this was my wording.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember the wording?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. For instance, incipient schizophrenia, I think she used; potentially
dangerous is something which I use. These are some of the expressions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. These expressions are peculiar to your particular type of work?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And not generally used by others?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. And by me generally in dealing with children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you keep the newspaper clipping by any chance that indicated
this?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you do after you learned or became aware that
Oswald was a child with whom you had had contact?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything, but the New York
Times sent a reporter, and he questioned me on whether I was the one to examine
this child, because they read it, and I said that I did not know for
sure, but it is possible.</p>

<p>And what happened then? Then very soon the FBI came in here and said,
"You are the doctor who examined Oswald," and from then on I know for sure
that it was me, because they must have read a report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, up until the time that the FBI came and said that you
were the doctor who interviewed Oswald, did you still have some doubt in your
mind as to whether you had actually interviewed the boy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. I was not convinced, I was not sure, until I then reconstructed
everything in my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As you have indicated, by <span class="locked">recalling&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. That is right, then I recalled everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you make any statement to television people in connection
with this at all?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. About Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No; on the day after President Kennedy died, the television
people asked me to make a statement on television in general about why somebody
might kill the President. I did not mention any name. I did not refer
to any individual. I just made some general psychiatric remarks as to what
kind of a person would kill the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recall approximately what you said?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. That a person who would commit such an act has been very
likely a mentally disturbed person, who has a personal grudge against persons
in authority, and very likely is a person who in his search to overcome his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
insignificance and helplessness will try to commit an act which will make others
frightened, which will shatter the world, which will make other people insecure,
as if he wanted to discharge his own insecurity through his own act, something
like that in general terms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it indicated by you at that time, or was it indicated on the
television broadcast that you were the psychiatrist who had examined Lee
Oswald?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It was not?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No, no. They didn't know. They called me because they call
me very often to give some psychiatric explanations of murderers or something
like that. They did not know, and I did not know for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At that time neither one of you <span class="locked">were&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. And they selected me. I mean it was a fantastic thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It was purely coincidence?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Coincidence that they selected me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you made no reference at that time to the examination which
you had made of Oswald?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. None at all. I didn't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Dr. Hartogs, do you have in your possession a copy of the report
which you made at the time you examined Oswald?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you had any opportunity to examine a copy of that report
since the assassination?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So the recollection that you have given us as regards your diagnosis
and your recommendations is strictly based on your own independent
recollection, plus the reconstruction of your interview with Oswald from the
seminar that you recall having given?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember anything else that particularly impressed
you about Oswald? The FBI report indicates that you were greatly impressed
by the boy, who was only 13½ years old at the time, because he had extremely
cold, steely eyes. Do you remember telling that to the agents?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes, yes; that he was not emotional at all; he was in control of
his emotions. He showed a cold, detached outer attitude. He talked about his
situation, about himself in a, what should I say, nonparticipating fashion. I
mean there was nothing emotional, affective about him, and this impressed
me. That was the only thing which I remembered; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, you recall also that Oswald was a slender and pale-faced
boy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember what particular thing it was about Oswald
that made you conclude that he had this severe personality disturbance? What
led you to this diagnosis?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. It was his suspiciousness against adults, as far as I recall, his
exquisite sensitivity in dealing with others, their opinions on his behalf. That
is as far as I recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form an opinion as to his intellectual ability, his
mental endowment?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes; but that I don't recall for sure. It was at least average
at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I want to mark "Exhibit 1" on the examination of Dr. Renatus
Hartogs, April 16, 1964, in New York, a photostatic copy of a document entitled
"Youth House Psychiatrist's Report," indicating a report on case No. 26996; date
of admission, April 16, 1953, exactly 11 years ago; date of examination, May 1,
1953, with regard to a boy by the name of Lee Harvey Oswald. I have initialed
a copy of this report for identification purposes, Doctor. Would you initial it
here next to my initials.</p>

<p>(Witness complies.)</p>

<p>(Photostatic copy of document entitled "Youth House Psychiatrist's Report"
marked "Exhibit 1.")</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you read the report and tell us if that is the report
that you prepared at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. That is right, that is it. Interesting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Doctor, is your recollection refreshed after looking at the
report that you made at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes, yes; that is the diagnosis, "personality pattern disturbance
with schizoid features and passive-aggressive tendencies." Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On page 1, at the very beginning of the report, you wrote at
that time, did you not, "This 13-year-old, well-built, well-nourished boy was
remanded to Youth House for the first time on charge of truancy."</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On the last page of the report there is a section entitled "Summary
for Probation Officer's Report," is there not?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you wrote there, about two or three sentences down, did
you not, "We arrive therefore at the recommendation that he should be placed
on probation under the condition that he seek help and guidance through contact
with a child guidance clinic, where he should be treated preferably by a
male psychiatrist who could substitute, to a certain degree at least, for the
lack of father figure. At the same time, his mother should be urged to seek
psychotherapeutic guidance through contact with a family agency. If this
plan does not work out favorably and Lee cannot cooperate in this treatment
plan on an outpatient basis, removal from the home and placement could be
resorted to at a later date, but it is our definite impression that treatment on
probation should be tried out before the stricter and therefore possibly more
harmful placement approach is applied to the case of this boy?"</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes. It contradicts my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes. As you now read your report&mdash;and it is perfectly understandable
that it is something that might not be remembered 11 years after the
event; I have no recollection of what I was doing 11 years ago.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. I did not know that I made this ambiguous recommendation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As you read this report and reflect on this report and on the
boy, Oswald, as he is revealed through it, do you think that possibly it may
have been somebody else that was involved in the seminar or are you convinced
that it was Oswald?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No; that was Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was Oswald?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It would not appear from this report that you found any indication
in the character of Lee Oswald at that time that would indicate this possible
violent outburst, is there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. I didn't mention it in the report, and I wouldn't recall it now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If you would have found it, you would have mentioned it in the
report?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. I would have mentioned it; yes. I just implied it with the
diagnosis of passive-aggressive. It means that we are dealing here with a
youngster who was hiding behind a seemingly passive, detached facade aggression
hostility. I mean this is what I thought was quite clear. I did not say
that he had assaultive or homicidal potential.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And in fact, as we read through the report, there is no mention
of the words "incipient schizophrenic" or "potentially dangerous" in the report.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No; I don't know where she has it from, but these are my words.
I use it in other reports, but here it is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. "Passive-aggressive tendencies" are fairly common in occurrence,
are they not amongst people?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No; it is not so common. It is the least common of the three
personality traits. It is either a passive-dependent child or an aggressive child,
and there is a passive-aggressive child. The passive-aggressive one is the least
common.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you describe for us briefly what the passive-aggressive
tendencies are, how do they manifest themselves, what do they indicate?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. They indicate a passive retiring surface facade, under which
the child hides considerable hostility of various degrees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It would indicate to some extent a hiding of hostile tendencies
toward others?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes. But usually in a passive-aggressive individual the aggressiveness
can be triggered off and provoked in stress situations or if he
nourishes his hate and his hostility for considerable length of time so that the
passive surface facade all of a sudden explodes, this can happen. I said here
that his fantasy life turned around the topics of omnipotence and power. He
said also that "I dislike everybody," which is quite interesting, I think, also
pertinent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You indicated that his mother was interviewed by the Youth
House social worker and is described as such-and-such. That would indicate,
would it not, to you that you personally did not see the mother?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. That is right. I did not see the mother personally, but the information
I have from the Youth House social worker's report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You indicated in the second sentence of the summary for the
probation officer's report, "No finding of neurological impairment or psychotic
mental changes could be made," did you not?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What do you mean when you say that "No finding of psychotic
mental changes could be made"?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. This child was not suffering from delusions and hallucinations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you couple that with the concept of neurological impairment
which indicated no brain damage or anything of that sort which
would cause hallucinations or disturbance of the personality?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember the circumstances of Oswald's home environment
here in New York at the time he came?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have no recollection of that. If I were to tell you now
that this boy came to New York with his mother, his father having died before
he was born, to live with one of his older brothers, and that they lived with
the brother here in Manhattan on 92d Street for a short time, after which
friction developed, and they then moved to the Bronx, the mother worked all
day, to support the child, in a department store here in New York or in
Brooklyn, and the boy apparently found difficulty in his relations with others
at school because he dressed differently, being from Texas, they lived apparently
on the Grand Concourse, which has been described to us at that time as
being a generally middle-class Jewish neighborhood, in which the boys did not
dress in levis or quite so casually as Oswald did; that he was given some
difficulty because of the fact that he did not speak the way the people did in
New York, he spoke with a southern Texas accent and did not understand the
patois of the city; assuming that those things were true, would that be a
partial explanation, do you think, of the way that he reacted to you during
the interview as reflected in your report?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No; I would not say. This was not the personality disturbance
which was the result of the situation of changes or conditioning; this was more
deeper going. A personality pattern disturbance is a disturbance which has
been existing since early childhood and has continued to exist through the
individual's life. It is not the result of recent conditioning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After reading your report, are you able to form an opinion or
did you form an opinion at that time of what might have caused this particular
personality pattern disturbance in this boy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. I mentioned it, I think, in the report, the lack of a father figure,
the lack of a real family life, neglect by self-involved mother. Yes; I think
these are the three factors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After reviewing the report, do you have any other remarks
that you think would be helpful to us in trying to understand what motivated
this boy, assuming that he was the assassin of the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That you haven't already talked about?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I will ask the reporter to set forth the text of the report at
the end of the deposition. I want to thank you very much for giving us the
time that you have, and on behalf of the Commission we want to tell you that
we appreciate it very much. Thanks very much, Doctor.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hartogs</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>"This 13 year old, well-built, well-nourished boy was remanded to Youth
House for the first time on charge of truancy from school and of being beyond
the control of his mother as far as school attendance is concerned. This is his
first contact with the law.</p>

<p>"He is&mdash;tense, withdrawn and evasive boy who dislikes intensely talking about
himself and his feelings. He likes <i>the</i> give the impression that he doesn't care
about others and rather likes to keep himself so that he is not bothered and
does not have to make the effort of communicating. It was difficult to penetrate
the emotional wall behind which this boy hides&mdash;and he provided us with
sufficient clues, permitting us to see intense anxiety, shyness, feelings of <i>awkwardness</i>
and insecurity as the main reasons for his withdrawal tendencies and
solitary habits. Lee told us: 'I don't want a friend and I don't like to talk to
people.' He describes himself as stubborn and according to his own saying likes
to say 'no.' Strongly resistive and negativistic features were thus noticed&mdash;but
psychotic mental content was denied and no indication of psychotic mental
changes was arrived at.</p>

<p>"Lee is a youngster with superior mental endowment functioning presently
on the bright normal range of mental efficiency. His abstract thinking capacity
and his vocabulary are well developed. No retardation in school subjects
could be found in spite of his truancy from school. Lee limits his interests
to reading magazines and looking at the television all day long. He dislikes
to play with others or to face the learning situation in school. On the other
hand he claims that he is 'very poor' in all school subjects and would need
remedial help. The discrepancy between the claims and his actual attainment
level show the low degree of self-evaluation and self-esteem at which this
boy has arrived presently, mainly due to feelings of general inadequacy and
emotional discouragement.</p>

<p>"Lee is the product of a broken home&mdash;as his father died before he was born.
Two older brothers are presently in the United States Army&mdash;while the mother
supports herself and Lee as an insurance broker. This occupation makes it
impossible for her to provide adequate supervision of Lee and to make him attend
school regularly. Lee is intensely dissatisfied with his present way of living,
but feels that the only way in which he can avoid feeling too unhappy is to
deny to himself competition with other children or expressing his needs and
wants. Lee claims that he can get very angry at his mother and occasionally has
hit her, particularly when she returns home without having bought food for
supper. On such occasions she leaves it to Lee to prepare some food with what
he can find in the kitchen. He feels that his mother rejects him and really has
never cared very much for him. He expressed the similar feeling with regard to
his brothers who live pretty much on their own without showing any brotherly
interest in him. Lee has vivid fantasy life, turning around the topics of
omnipotence and power, through which he tries to compensate for his present
shortcomings and frustrations. He did not enjoy being <i>together</i> with other
children and when we asked him whether he prefers the company of boys to
<i>the one</i> of girls&mdash;he answered&mdash;'I dislike everybody.' His occupational goal
is to join the Army. His mother was interviewed by the Youth House social
worker and is described by her as a 'defensive, rigid, self-involved and intellectually
alert' woman who finds it exceedingly difficult to understand Lee's personality
and his withdrawing behavior. She does not understand that Lee's
withdrawal is a form of violent but silent protest against his neglect by her&mdash;and
represents his reaction to a complete absence of any real family life. She
seemed to be interested enough in the welfare of this boy to be willing to seek
guidance and help as regards her own difficulties and her management of Lee.</p>

<p>"Neurological examination remained essentially negative with the exception
of slightly impaired hearing in the left ear, resulting from a mastoidectomy in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
1946. History of convulsions and accidental injuries to the skull was denied.
Family history is negative for mental disease.</p>

<p>"<i>Summary for Probation Officer's Report</i>:</p>

<p>"This 13-year-old, well-built boy, has superior mental resources and functions
only slightly below his capacity level in spite of chronic truancy from school&mdash;which
brought him into Youth House. No finding of neurological impairment
or psychotic mental changes could be made. Lee has to be diagnosed as 'personality
pattern disturbance with schizoid features and passive-aggressive
tendencies.' Lee has to be seen as an emotionally, quite disturbed youngster who
suffers under the impact of really existing emotional isolation and deprivation;
lack of affection, absence of family life and rejection by a self-involved and
conflicted mother. Although Lee denies that he is in need of any <i>other</i> form of
help other than 'remedial' one, we gained the definite impression that Lee can be
reached through contact with an understanding and very patient psychotherapist
and if he could be drawn at the same time into group psychotherapy. We
arrive therefore at the recommendation that he should be placed on probation
under the condition that he seek help and guidance through contact with a child
guidance clinic, where he should be treated preferably by a male psychiatrist
who could substitute, to a certain degree at least, for the lack of father figure.
At the same time, his mother should be urged to seek psychotherapeutic guidance
through contact with a family agency. If this plan does not work out
favorably and Lee cannot cooperate in this treatment plan on an out-patient
basis, removal from the home and placement could be resorted to at a later date,
but it is our definite impression that treatment on probation should be tried out
before the stricter and therefore possibly more harmful placement approach
is applied to the case of this boy. The Big Brother movement could be undoubtedly
of tremendous value in this case and Lee should be urged to join the
organized group activities of his community, such as provided by the PAL or
YMCA of his neighborhood."</p>

<h2 id="t224"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_EVELYN_GRACE_STRICKMAN_SIEGEL" id="TESTIMONY_OF_EVELYN_GRACE_STRICKMAN_SIEGEL">TESTIMONY OF EVELYN GRACE STRICKMAN SIEGEL</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Evelyn Grace Strickman Siegel was taken at 2:39 p.m., on
April 17, 1964, at the U.S. Courthouse, Foley Square, New York, N.Y., by
Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Evelyn Grace Strickman Siegel, having been first duly sworn, was examined
and testified as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mrs. Siegel, my name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am a member
of the legal staff of the President's Commission investigating the assassination
of President Kennedy. Staff members have been authorized to take the testimony
of witnesses by the Commission pursuant to authority granted to the
Commission by Executive Order No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and Joint
Resolution of Congress No. 137.</p>

<p>Pursuant to the authority so granted to it, the Commission has promulgated
certain rules governing the taking of testimony from witnesses, which provide,
among other things, that each witness is entitled to 3 days' notice before he or
she is required to give testimony. I know you didn't get 3 days' notice of
this, but each witness also has the power to waive that notice, and I assume that
you will be willing to waive that notice, and go ahead with the testimony since
you are here. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Yes. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We want to advise you also that the rules provide that if you
wish to have a copy of your transcript, you may have it at your own expense,
at such time as the Commission releases the transcripts, releases the testimony,
and that you are entitled to counsel if you wish. You don't have counsel here,
and I assume you do not wish it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. No. I do not wish it. Will I be advised when the transcripts
are released?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes. The Commission understands that you were working as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
a social worker in 1953 and 1954, at which time Lee Harvey Oswald and his
mother lived here in New York City. Before we go into the details of that,
I would like to have you state your full name for the record, if you would.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Evelyn Grace Strickman Siegel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. 1347 River Road, Teaneck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And am I correct in understanding that you did work in New
York as a social worker?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you begin working as a social worker?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. In March of 1950.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long did you continue in that work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. I'm still working as a social worker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In the city?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Yes; on a part-time basis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you outline briefly for us your educational background?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. A.B., Hunter College; M.S., Columbia University, School of
Social Work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And in 1953, at the time that you did have contact with the
Oswalds, you had been doing social work for about 3 years; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. For whom did you work as a social worker?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Youth House.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you still working for Youth House?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. No; I'm not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you begin working for Youth House and when did
you terminate your employment with Youth House?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. I began working for them in January of 1952, and I left in
August&mdash;well, I left Youth House for Girls, which is part of the same institution
setup, in August of 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you describe for us briefly the nature of the Youth House
as it existed in 1953?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. In what aspect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What kind of institution was it? What kind of people went
there? What was done with them there? Will you tell me?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. It was a remand center for boys, delinquent boys who had gotten
into trouble with the court and were remanded to Youth House for a brief
period of diagnostic study. Upon their reappearance in court, so far as I understood
it, those children who had been assigned for diagnostic study went back
to court accompanied by a report from Youth House, which was given to the
judge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What kind of a report was this? What was in it? What did
it say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. A full-scale diagnostic study includes a social history taken by
the social worker after one or several interviews with the boy and an interview
with a parent, as well as an interview with the Youth House psychiatrist; that
is, the boy was interviewed by the Youth House psychiatrist. All this material
was then typed up and sent to court.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who was the Youth House psychiatrist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Dr. Renatus Hartogs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Dr. Hartogs personally interview each boy, or were
there other psychiatrists who sometimes interviewed the boys and reported,
do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. First of all, let me say that not every boy was seen by a psychiatrist
or a social worker. Also, the caseload was shared from time to time by other
psychiatrists on the staff of Youth House, not by Dr. Hartogs alone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There was a report of the psychiatrist, then, a report of the
social worker, and were there any other reports of any other workers, generally
speaking, attached to the court report?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Incorporated into the social worker's report was a report from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
those workers on the floor where the boy lived, the counselors, so to speak, brief
reports as to his behavior and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Those would be given to the social workers; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And used as a basis for the social worker's report?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Not as a basis for it but incorporated into it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So as a general proposition, the reports of people from the
floor would be before the social worker when she prepared her report and
would usually be reflected in the report of the social worker; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any recollection of any contact during the course of
your work as a social worker for Youth House with Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. After the President's assassination, the name meant nothing to
me. As the biographies in the papers started to appear, and it was said
that this boy was in Youth House in 1953, I believe it was, I had a vague stirring
of memory, and I then said to my husband that somehow I have a mental picture
of this youngster. At the time I attributed him not to me but to another
worker. I somehow thought that he was assigned to another worker. But I
had a picture of what he looked like, and the only reason that I think I
remember him is that he was from Texas, and he was distinctive because he
had an accent that was different from most of the children I saw, and he wore
blue jeans, which most of our kids didn't wear in those days. And that was
all I remembered about it. I remembered absolutely nothing about him at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And your recollection of Lee Oswald is still the same as it was
at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Sitting in the corner of my office, a slim, skinny little boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is to say, you have not been able to refresh your recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And improve it at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Since <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. No. I must have seen between 400 and 450 boys a year in those
days. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember talking to his mother at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. No; I do not. I don't even know if I saw her. I am terribly
curious to see my report again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long do you know Dr. Hartogs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Well, we were associated over a period of from 1952 to 1958&mdash;6
years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you seen him since that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. No; we don't see each other socially at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you haven't spoken to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. No; I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. About the Oswald case; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. No; I haven't seen him since I left Youth House.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any recollection that from time to time the
psychiatrist, Dr. Hartogs, would give seminars as a technique to instruct or
provide examples to the social workers and perhaps the psychologists and other
employees of Youth House?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Well, I don't remember that Dr. Hartogs gave the seminars.
We all participated in them, social workers and psychiatrists. I remember
them vividly. I was a participant, myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I didn't mean to characterize Dr. Hartogs' role as being the
sole role.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But there were seminars?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Oh, there were seminars. Certainly. I misunderstood you.
Yes; there were seminars which took place weekly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any recollection that Lee Oswald was the subject
of one of these seminars?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any recollection of what the reason for Oswald's
being remanded to Youth House was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. I only read in the paper that it was truancy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you have no independent recollection about it otherwise
at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I show you a photostatic copy of a document entitled "Youth
House, Social Worker's Report," which is dated Bronx, May 7, 1953, referring
to case No. 26996. This report indicates that the social worker involved was
Evelyn Strickman, which would at that time have been you; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And still is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I hand you this document, and tell me if that is the report
which you prepared in connection with your work with Lee Harvey Oswald.
Are you able to state whether or not that is the report you prepared?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. This is indubitably mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. These reports were prepared shortly after your contact with
the boy, with the mother, or prepared from notes that you made of the interview,
were they not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Oh, yes; they were prepared probably during the time he was
still at Youth House.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The point being that the report would accurately reflect the
interview that you had both with Lee Oswald and with his mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. As accurately as I could; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And it was prepared on or about the time that you conducted
the interview, was it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Correct, yes; and shortly afterward.</p>

<p>(Document marked "Exhibit 1.")</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have marked the photostatic copy of the exhibit as Exhibit
1 to the deposition of Evelyn Strickman Siegel, April 17, 1964, and I have
initialed it for purposes of identification. I would ask if you would initial it
also so that we can make sure that we are talking about the same thing.</p>

<p>(Witness complies.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I show you another report, which upon examination you will
note contains much of the same material as is set forth in the Exhibit No. 1,
and ask you if you recognize the sheaf of photostatic copies which I have just
shown you and if you can tell me what they are.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. This is my report. Just a minute. This is what I dictated
into the record before I pulled from it the essential material which should
go into the report to the court.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that the photostatic document that I have just shown you
was prepared before Exhibit No. 1, and closer in time to your actual contact
with the boy and with the mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. This is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The one you have in your hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And from the document you hold in your hand you prepared
Exhibit No. 1, which is the formal report which was submitted to the court
along with the report of Dr. Hartogs and perhaps of other personnel; is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. This is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We will mark the document to which we have just been referring,
which is captioned "Oswald, Lee Harvey&mdash;Charge: Truancy," and has
"Youth House" written at the top of it, and which consists of 7 pages, the last
of which has the typewritten name "Evelyn Strickman" and the date 4-30-53,
and bears your initials&mdash;does it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Those are the initials of Marion Cohen, who was casework
supervisor at Youth House at that time. That shows she read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She read it also?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And we will mark the document Exhibit No. 2.</p>

<p>(Document marked "Exhibit 2.")</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Wait a minute. Let me just correct that. Marion would have
written her own initials. That isn't my handwriting. I never made an "E" like
that. I don't know who did that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have no question, however, that this is the report prepared
by you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. No; I have absolutely no question. This is my dictation into the
record. I know&mdash;that was Sadie Skolnick. That was the undersupervisor at the
time. That is who that S.S. is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have initialed Exhibit 2. So that we are sure we are talking
about the same exhibit, would you initial it also, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Sure. [Witness complies.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Exhibit 1 consists of six pages; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After reviewing the report which you prepared in connection
with Lee Oswald back in 1953, is your recollection refreshed so that you could
add anything other than that which is already set forth in the written report
which you prepared at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. No; I can't add a thing to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you say after reviewing the report that you prepared at
that time that this boy gave any indication to you back in 1953, that is, as indicated
in your report, that he had any violent tendencies or tendencies in this
direction, in the direction of violence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Well, I can only say from what I wrote in that report that apparently
this was a youngster who was teetering on the edge of serious emotional
illness. Now, whether that included violence I am not prepared to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You couldn't say that one way or the other from the material
set forth in your report; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Yes; I would say that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of anything else that you would like to add to the
record after reviewing these reports that you think might be helpful to the Commission
in its work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. I am sorry, there is nothing I can add.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have no more questions. I want to thank you very much on
behalf of the Commission.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Not at all. It is a real tragedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Thank you very much, Mrs. Siegel.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siegel</span>. Yes; not at all. Thank you. Goodbye.</p>

<h2 id="t228"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_NELSON_DELGADO" id="TESTIMONY_OF_NELSON_DELGADO">TESTIMONY OF NELSON DELGADO</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Nelson Delgado was taken on April 16, 1964, at the U.S.
Courthouse, Foley Square, New York, N.Y., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Nelson Delgado, having been first duly sworn, was examined and testified as
follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am a member of the legal
staff of the President's Commission investigating the assassination of President
Kennedy. Staff members have been authorized to take the testimony of witnesses
by the Commission pursuant to authority granted to the Commission by
Executive Order No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution of
Congress No. 137.</p>

<p>Under the Commission's rules for the taking of testimony, each witness is to
be provided with a copy of the Executive order and of the joint resolution, and
a copy of the rules that the Commission has adopted governing the taking of
testimony from witnesses.</p>

<p>The Commission will provide you copies of those documents. I cannot do it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
at this point because I do not have them with me, but we will provide you with
copies of the documents to which I have referred.</p>

<p>Under the Commission's rules for the taking of testimony, each witness is
entitled to 3 days' notice before he is required to come in and give testimony.
I don't think you had 3 days' notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But each witness can waive that notice requirement if he
wishes, and I assume that you would be willing to waive that notice requirement
since you are here; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We want to inquire of you this morning concerning the association
that the Commission understands you had with Lee Harvey Oswald during
the time that he was a member of the United States Marine Corps. The Commission
has been advised that you also were a member of the United States
Marine Corps and were stationed with Oswald in Santa Ana, Calif., for a period
of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Before we get into the details of that, would you state your
full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Nelson Delgado.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are now in the United States Army; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your rank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Specialist 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your serial number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. RA282 53 799.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where are you stationed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I am stationed at Delta Battery, 4th Missile Battalion, 71st
Artillery, in Hazlet, N.J.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long have you been in the Army?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I joined the Army on November 1, 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What kind of work do you do in the Army?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I am a 94116, which means that I am a cook, with a linguist
digit, which means I can speak and write Spanish fluently. That is what that
last 6 in that digit means.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you go into the Army?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I went into the Army at Fort Ord, Calif.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And would you briefly tell us the training that you received
after you went into the Army and the places at which you were stationed from
the time you went into the Army up to the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, in 1960, November 1960, I reported at Fort Ord. Approximately
15 days after I reported there I received orders for Germany. I had no
basic training because of my Marine Corps basic training took care of that.</p>

<p>December the 15th, 14th, around there, I left for Germany. And I arrived
in Germany, and I served with Headquarters Battery, 5th Missile Battalion, 6th
Artillery, APO 34, at Baumholder. Germany.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long were you stationed in Germany?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I was stationed there approximately 2 years and a day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you stationed with the same outfit all that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. Six months of the time I was with them; then I was transferred
to a line battery, C Battery, same missile battalion, same artillery, and
I was for a while the old man's driver, the captain's driver; and then I was&mdash;I
asked for a transfer to the messhall so I could get advanced in my rating, and
I was put in the messhall, then promoted there also, and I have been a cook
since then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you stay with the C Battery until you left Germany?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Approximately when did you leave Germany?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. December the 8th. December the 8th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. 1962, right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where were you stationed after that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Fort Hancock, NJ.; and from there I was put in the line battery,
Delta Battery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that is where you are assigned at the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you working now as a cook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are also the mess steward of your messhall; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No, not mess steward; first cook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. First cook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you are not in charge of the messhall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; I am in charge of the personnel that work the day I am
working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned that your MOS, I believe it is called, your
military occupation specialty, has an indication that you are qualified to speak
Spanish or another language; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you take tests while you were in the Army to establish
your proficiency in the Spanish language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes, I took the language proficiency test, and also the OCS
test, the regular test they give you when you first go into the service, and I
passed them all. It's in my 201 files, my military records.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you pass the Spanish proficiency test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes. In fact I was offered to be sent to Monterey language
school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To continue your studies in connection with the Spanish language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You took the Spanish proficiency test when you came into the
Army at Fort Ord; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1939.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At what address? Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I believe it was Kings County Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your parents still reside in Brooklyn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. 303 47th Street. That's what my address was during the
Marine Corps, but right now the neighborhood is tore down, so there's no
record of it now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your parents reside in Brooklyn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. My parents are divorced. One lives in Puerto Rico, and
my mother lives in California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You lived at the address in Brooklyn that you just gave me
from the time you were born until the time you went into the Marine Corps;
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us briefly where you went to school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That's pretty hard to keep track of, because I was like a yo-yo,
back and forth from one parent to the other. But I went to school in P.S. No. 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Brooklyn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. In Brooklyn, until the third grade, and I was transferred. I
went to California with my mother. I was there in the Park Avenue Grammar
School from the third grade to the fifth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What city in California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Wilmington, Calif. And then I went back to New York, back
to P.S. No. 2 for the 5th grade to the 6th, graduated from there, went to
public school, Dewey Junior High School&mdash;I don't know what P.S. it is&mdash;from
the 7th grade to the 8th and then went back to California and went to Wilmington
Junior High School from the 7th to the&mdash;about the 11th grade, and the
11th grade I went back to Brooklyn into Manual Training High School and
dropped out after the 11th grade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have not graduated from high school?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. I have my high school graduation through USAFI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is the United States Armed Forces Institute; is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you dropped out of school here in Brooklyn, did you
then join the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. I held a job for a while at Van Dyk &amp; Reeves, on 42d
Street and 2d Avenue, in Brooklyn, N.Y.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What kind of a job was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. It was just a regular laborer at an olive factory, making Maraschino
cherries and olives and so forth. And it lasted about 2½ months, and I
joined the Marine Corps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do both of your parents speak Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are they both from Puerto Rico originally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Approximately when did they come from Puerto Rico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. My father came when he was roughly 20 years of age. My
mother came when she was about 13.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Approximately hold old are your parents now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. My father is around 48. My mother is about 42.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you join the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Down at Whitehall Street, in New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What training did you receive? Where were you sent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, when we left New York I was sent to Parris Island, S.C.,
for basic training. Upon completion of that, I was sent to Camp Le Jeune,
N.C., for intensive training. Then I received schooling in electronics school at
Jacksonville Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Fla.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember when you were there at Jacksonville?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I was there in 19&mdash;the the beginning of 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is the exact title of the school that you went to? Do
you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Electronics school is all I can remember. From there, upon
graduation from there, I received my choice of training, which was aircraft
control and warning, and I was sent to school at Biloxi Air Force Base, Miss.,
and there I went to aircraft control and warning school there, and it lasted
about 7 weeks. Upon completion there and graduation, I received my orders
for Marine Air Control Squadron 9, Santa Ana, Calif.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Approximately when did you arrive at Santa Ana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. The beginning of 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you make the acquaintance of Lee Harvey Oswald at any
time prior to the time that you arrived at Santa Ana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't know Oswald while you were in school at Biloxi
or Jacksonville?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. He was past that already.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald had been to these schools?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you learn subsequently that Oswald had been in school
in Jacksonville and Biloxi?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. All of us in MOS 6741 knew that he had been there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. For the benefit of the record, MOS stands for Military Occupation
Specialty. Is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And the MOS number that you have just referred to was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Airborne electronics operators is about the equivalent, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Airborne electronics operator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; our job was the surveillance of aircraft in distress, control
of intercepts and approaches, and mostly air surveillance and help of
aircraft running into problems.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long were you stationed at Santa Ana?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. From 1958, I would say, until November 2, 1959, when I got
discharged.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you were at Santa Ana after you completed your training,
throughout your entire Marine Corps career?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Until the time you were discharged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have access to classified information of any sort in
the course of your work at Santa Ana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; we all had access to information, classified information.
I believe it was classified secret. We all had secret clearances. There was
some information there as to different codes and challenges that we had to give
to aircraft and challenges and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In other words, if I can understand correctly the nature of your
work, you actually worked in a control room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Observing radar screens?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And when the radar screen would pick up an aircraft, you
would then challenge that aircraft?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And it would have to identify itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That's true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And the code or signals that you sent to the aircraft requesting
it to identify itself were classified information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That's right, along with the range capabilities of the radar
sets and their blindspots and so forth and so on. You know, each site has blindspots,
and we know the degrees where our blindspots are and who covers us and
that information. That's considered secret, what outfit covers us and things like
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And what was the <span class="locked">latter&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. What outfit covers us, that we can see. And as I say, the
capabilities of the radars, as I said before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How far out they can reach?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And pick up an aircraft?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; and how <span class="locked">high&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And how <span class="locked">high&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. And how low we can catch them and where we can't catch them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And I suppose all the men who worked with the radar sets knew
these things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. They all knew. What do they call it now&mdash;authentication
charts, which is also a secret.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is the nature of these charts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Authorization chart is, if we receive an order over the phone,
over the headsets&mdash;authentication. Pardon me. That's the word. Let's say
this order, we can question it. What it actually amounts to, he has to authenticate
it for us. Now, he should have the same table or code in front of him that
I have. He gives me a code. I would look it up in my authentication chart,
decipher it, and I could tell whether or not this man has the same thing I am
using. And this changes from hour to hour, see. There's no chance of it&mdash;and
day to day, also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that the information, the code itself would not be of any
particular value to the enemy, since it is changed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. It's changed from day to day; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did there come a time when you were stationed at Santa Ana
that you met Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; in the beginning of 1959. He arrived at our outfit. I
didn't take no particular notice of him at the time, but later on we had&mdash;we
started talking, and we got to know each other quite well. This is all before
Christmas, before I took my leave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was in 1957 or 1958?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. 1958. And we had basic interests. He liked Spanish, and he
talked to me for a while in Spanish or tried to, and since nobody bothered, you
know&mdash;I was kind of a loner, myself, you know. I didn't associate with too
many people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How old were you at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I was 17&mdash;18 years of age; 17 or 18.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. About the same age as Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. He was the same age as I was. And nothing really developed
until I went on leave&mdash;&mdash;oh, yes. At the time he was&mdash;he was commenting
on the fight that Castro was having at Sierra Madres at the beginning, just
about the turn of 1959. When I went on leave, it just so happened that my
leave coincided with the first of January, when Castro took over. So when I
got back, he was the first one to see me, and he said, "Well, you took a leave
and went there and helped them, and they all took over." It was a big joke.</p>

<p>So we got along pretty well. He had trouble in one of the huts, and he
got transferred to mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know what trouble he had in the other hut?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, the way I understand it, he wouldn't hold his own.
Came time for cleanup, and general cleanliness of the barracks, he didn't want
to participate, and he would be griping all the time. So the sergeant that was
in charge of that hut asked to have him put out, you know. So consequently,
they put him into my hut.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What were these huts? Were they quonset huts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Quonset huts, right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And they served as barracks, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many <span class="locked">men&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Each quonset hut was divided in half. Now, in each half lived
six men, two to a room. They were divided into two rooms with a bath room
each side, each half of the quonset hut. I was living in one room. Oswald in
the other room. And then we had our barracks, we had quite a bit of turnovers,
because guys kept coming in and being transferred. Him and I seemed
to be the only ones staying in there. And we would meet during working hours
and talk. He was a complete believer that our way of government was not
quite right, that&mdash;I don't know how to say it; it's been so long. He was for,
not the Communist way of life, the Castro way of life, the way he was going to
lead his people. He didn't think our Government had too much to offer.</p>

<p>He never said any subversive things or tried to take any classified information
that I know of out or see anybody about it.</p>

<p>As I said to the men that interviewed me before, we went to the range at
one time, and he didn't show no particular aspects of being a sharpshooter at
all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He didn't seem to be particularly proficient with the rifle; is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What kind of rifle did you use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He had an M-1. We all had M-1's</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Carbine or rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. The M-1 rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have them in your quonset hut at all times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No, sir; we had them in the armory, in the quonset hut designated
as the armory. And we went there periodically to clean them up. And
at the time in Santa Ana, he was with me at one <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Each man was assigned a particular rifle; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have to use the rifles to stand inspection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember whether or not Oswald kept his rifle in good
shape, clean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He kept it mediocre. He always got gigged for his rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He did?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; very seldom did he pass an inspection without getting
gigged for one thing or another.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. With respect to his rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. With respect to his rifle. He didn't spend as much time as
the rest of us did in the armory cleaning it up. He would, when he was told
to. Otherwise, he wouldn't come out by himself to clean it. He was basically
a man that complained quite frequently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think he complained more than the other Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, yes; a little bit more. Anything, anything that they told
him to do, he found a way to argue it to a point where both him and the man
giving him the order both got disgusted and mad at each other, and while the
rest of us were working, he's arguing with the man in charge. For him there
was always another way of doing things, an easier way for him to get something
done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He didn't take too well to orders that were given to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever notice that he responded better if he were asked
to do something instead of ordered to do something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; well, that's what I worked with him. I never called him
Lee or Harvey or Oswald. It was always Oz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Ozzie. I would say, "Oz, how about taking care of the bathroom
today?" Fine, he would do it. But as far as somebody from the outside
saying, "All right, Oswald, I want you to take and police up that area"&mdash;"Why?
Why do I have to do it? Why are you always telling me to do it?" Well, it
was an order, he actually had to do it, but he didn't understand it like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long were you and Oswald stationed together at Santa
Ana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Basically there were 11 months, from January to the date of
my discharge or the date that he took off. He got discharged before I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. August or September 1959, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. 1959, right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And when were you discharged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I was discharged November 2, 1960&mdash;1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald tell you that he had been overseas prior to the
time he came to Santa Ana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; he didn't tell me has was overseas. I got that from the
fellows who knew him overseas, Atsugi, Japan, and he was with the Marine
Air Control Squadron, I believe it was, at Atsugi. There was a couple of
guys stationed with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; I don't. I think one of them was Dijonovich. There
was two of them stationed with him overseas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever learn whether Oswald had been any place else
overseas other than Atsugi?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never heard that he was stationed in the Philippines for
a while?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; not that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know whether any of these other men that had been
stationed overseas with Oswald had been to the Philippines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; if they went on a problem from there and got aboard a
small carrier, they probably may have taken him, say, to Hawaii or the Philippines
or Guam, something like that, for maneuvers, or Okinawa.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you had no knowledge of it at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were about to tell us, before I went into this question of
how long you and Oswald were together, about the rifle practice that you
engaged in. Would you tell us about that in as much detail as you can
remember?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. We went out to the field, to the rifle range, and before we set
out we had set up a pot. High score would get this money; second highest,
and so forth down to about the fifth man that was high.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many men were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Oh, in our company there was about roughly 80 men, 80 to 100
men, and I would say about 40 of us were in the pot. All low ranking EM's,
though. By that I mean corporal or below. None of the sergeants were asked
to join. Nine times out of ten they weren't firing, just watching you. They
mostly watched to see who was the best firer on the line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say there were about 40 men involved in this pot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you say that Oswald finished fifth from the highest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; he didn't even place there. He didn't get no money at all.
He just barely got his score, which I think was about 170, I think it was, just
barely sharpshooter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Sharpshooter is the <span class="locked">minimum&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Minimum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Rank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. It's broken down into three categories: sharpshooters&mdash;no;
pardon me, take that back; it's marksman is the lowest, sharpshooters, and
experts. And then Oswald had a marksman's badge, which was just a plain,
little thing here which stated "Marksman" on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that was the lowest one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That was the lowest. Well, that was qualifying; then there
was nothing, which meant you didn't qualify.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you fire with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right; I was in the same line. By that I mean we were on
line together, the same time, but not firing at the same position, but at the
same time, and I remember seeing his. It was a pretty big joke, because he
got a lot of "Maggie's drawers," you know, a lot of misses, but he didn't give a
darn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Missed the target completely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He just qualified, that's it. He wasn't as enthusiastic as the
rest of us. We all loved&mdash;liked, you know, going to the range.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My recollection of how the rifle ranges worked is that the
troops divided up into two different groups, one of which operates the targets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And the other one fires?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you said before that you were in the same line as Oswald,
you meant that you fired at the same time that he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. And then all of us went to the pits, our particular lines;
then we went to the pits, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald worked the pits with you, the same time you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. And he was a couple of targets down. It was very
comical to see, because he had the other guy pulling the target down, you know,
and he will take and maybe gum it once in a while or run the disk up; but he
had the other guy pulling it up and bringing it down, you know. He wasn't
hardly going to exert himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember approximately how far away Oswald was
in the line from you when you fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; he was just one over from me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The next one, the very next one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Not the next one, but the one over from that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There was one man between you and Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to him about his performance with the rifle at
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Not during that day, because I was mostly interested in my
picking up the money, you know, and I wasn't worrying about what he was
doing; in fact if he wasn't bringing it in, I didn't care, you know. I didn't
want no competition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you win any of the money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many of the Marines won?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Just five of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Just five?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And which one were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I was&mdash;I shot about 192. I came in about third.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My recollection of the rifle range from the time I was in the
Army is that sometimes the scores that were <span class="locked">reported&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Were erroneous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were erroneous. Has that been your experience also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Oh, yes; if there is not close supervision. By this, that you
have your buddy in back of you, he could be penciling in your score; if you get
a 4, he will put a 5 in there. It doesn't work that way if you go to fire for
record, like we did, because they have an NCO line and they got a pit NCO.
Now they have a man at that target down there keeping score, and they also
have a man back here keeping score, and when both those score cards are turned
into the line officer, they both better correspond, and you have no way of communicating
with the man down the pit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that the way it was handled when you fired this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So there was very little, if any, chance that Oswald's score
could have been fixed up; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. The only time you could fix up the score, when you go down for
just straight firing, what they call battery column firing, and there is nobody
to supervise, you pencil yourself. The Marines is pretty strict about that when
you go for line firing. They want both scorecards to correspond with each
other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is this the only time that you <span class="locked">fired&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. With Oswald during the time that you were stationed at Santa
Ana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned before in your testimony that you had been
interviewed prior to this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. By whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. FBI agents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember approximately when they talked to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. They talked to me about five times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. About five times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Could it have been three times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. One is at home, twice in the battery&mdash;no, four times, because
they visited me once at home, twice at the battery, the same fellow; then he
brought another man in. Yes; four times. Two different fellows. And one
time one was a Spanish&mdash;I don't know, I guess he was a Spanish interpreter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He spoke Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He spoke Castilian Spanish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Castilian Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is a different kind of Spanish from the kind you speak?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. All right. He could go out here in New York City and go down
in Spanish Harlem and he would be lost. I mean it would be all right if 90
percent of the Spanish people down there were college graduates, they could
understand him. They don't speak that type of Spanish there, nor do they speak
it in a lot of other Spanish countries. It's like speaking the English as spoken
in England, you know. You can't expect a man from Georgia to try and understand
a man from England the way he speaks pure English.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have difficulty in understanding this agent when he
spoke to you in Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. See, I took it in high school. But he had difficulty in interpreting
my Spanish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you think he was likely to have gotten the opinion that you
weren't very proficient in Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. But I would be willing to challenge him if he and I go
down to Spanish Harlem and see who gets across faster.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form an impression of these FBI agents when they
talked to you? Were <span class="locked">they&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. The one fellow, the older one, white-haired fellow, he was a
nice guy. And the two other ones, I never seen them before, two different fellows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many agents talked to you altogether?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I don't know if this Spanish guy was an agent or not. He
never introduced himself. But there was this white-haired fellow, and then
two different men; three men altogether, not including this Spanish guy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So there would have been four men altogether?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are quite sure about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell me approximately when these people talked to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. The first time I came in contact was, let's see, about January
was the first time I was contacted by the white-haired fellow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was he the fellow who spoke Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; he was the man from the Red Bank office, I believe he said
he was, Red Bank, N.J. And then 2 weeks later he came to the battery to see me,
about a month later he came back with this Spanish fellow, and about another
month these other two fellows came in. They were all FBI agents though.
They showed me their book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The first time that the white-haired agent talked to you was
when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. About January, about a month or a month and a half after
Kennedy's assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Could it have been in the middle of December?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; I don't think it was that close. Let's see, November 22&mdash;I
think it was more to the last part of December, not to the middle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did this FBI agent talk to you about this rifle practice that you
have just told us about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember what you told him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Basically the same thing I told you, except he didn't ask for it
like you did, about the possibility of forging the score, and I didn't explain to
him about the NCOs in the lines and in the pits, also keeping the score.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You told the FBI that in your opinion Oswald was not a good
rifle shot; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that he did not show any unusual interest in his rifle, and
in fact appeared less interested in weapons than the average marine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes. He was mostly a thinker, a reader. He read quite a bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You told us just a few minutes ago that you took third in the
pool; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did the FBI agent ask you about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. He asked me how I placed. I told him I placed pretty
high; that's about all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In the report that I have in front of me of an interview that
Special Agents Richard B. Murdoch and James A. Marley, Jr., took of you on
January 15, 1964, at Holmdel, N.J., which would have been at the base&mdash;is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It appears from the record here, from the report that I have, that
the Spanish-speaking agent was Mr. Murdoch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that this would have been the time that the Spanish-speaking
man was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. That was the third visit I had from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss at that time the rifle practice, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; I did. I discussed the rifle practice all the time they
came up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. They asked you the same questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right; same thing over and over again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, the report that I have says that Oswald, like most marines,
took an interest in the pool&mdash;they call it a pool instead of a pot, but that
is the same thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; pool.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald took an interest in the pool, which was started for
the marine getting the highest score. It says, however, "Delgado said neither
he nor Oswald came close to winning."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No, no; that is erroneous, because I won. He didn't win at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never told these FBI agents that you yourself did not
come close to winning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; because I was&mdash;I was one of the highest ones there, I always
had an expert badge on me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were a good rifle shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; just like I got one now [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is an expert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes. This is a sharpshooter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have both a sharpshooter and an expert badge; is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. One for the M-1 rifle and the other for the carbine&mdash;rather,
this is the M-14, the new one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The scores that you got on that practice would be reflected in
your military records, would they not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right; in all our&mdash;well, I think they call them 201 files also in
the Marines Corps&mdash;I can't remember what they are now, but they are all there,
especially that one particular day, because that goes into your records. That's
why they are so strict.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And there is no chance in connection with that qualification
firing that you can pencil in your score?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did not tell the FBI that in your opinion Oswald had
penciled in his qualifying score, did you? Or did you tell them that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He may have done, you know; but if you got away with it
you were more than lucky.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to the FBI about that possibility?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes, I told him he may have, to qualify, because there was a
lot of "Maggie's drawers" on his side. Now, he may have had some way of knowing
who was pulling, that is another thing. You don't know who is out there in
the pits, pulling it, see; and it could be a buddy of yours or somebody you
know, and they will help you out, you know, get together, like before we all
go and separate, you know, and I will say to my buddy, "Well, look, I want
to try and get on line 22, you get on target 22, and I will try to be the first
one on line"; so help each other like that, And when they go to the pits, they
have their choice of getting on the lines, you know, so I will try to work it out
with the fellow out there. But sometimes it doesn't work out that way. You
just have to take your chances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You told us that in this particular rifle practice, or firing, that
the scores were kept by NCOs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it a common practice for the privates to make deals like
this with the noncommissioned officers in connection with a thing like this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. They are making a deal with the other guys pulling the targets.
See, the guy back there is also keeping a score.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
Now, your NCO, particularly your NCO, may want to push you or make you
qualify, because he doesn't want to spend another day out there on the rifle
range, see; so it's not all that strict. Like if I was line NCO and I had five
men in my section, and four of them qualified, that means that some other day,
maybe on my day off, I will have to come in with this other fellow, so I will
help him along and push each other along.</p>

<p>You don't try to mess nobody up, but you can't take a man that is shooting
poorly and give him a 190 score, see; you could just give him the bare minimum,
170 or 171, to make it look good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Just to qualify him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Just to qualify him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So it is a possibility that that might have happened even in
connection with this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You said that you came in about third in this pool?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember who the marines were that won it and took
second place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. These men were mostly transients. Like I said, I didn't
have too many close friends in the Marine Corps. I went to school with quite
a few of them that were stationed with us, but I never got real close to any of
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This statement in this FBI report indicates that you said
that neither you nor Oswald came close to winning the pool and that just must be
a mistake; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes, correct. I think in the first statement, too I said that
I have won too, I believe, the first one he took. I won, but he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The first report indicates that you said that Oswald was a
poor shot and didn't do well, but it doesn't say anything about how you did.
Do you remember discussing how you did with the FBI in the first interview
that you had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes, the first one was at home. We had more time to talk,
and I was at ease there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And where would that have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. The address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. 31 Oakwood Road&mdash;30 Oakwood Road, Leonardo, N.J.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say that this incident where you had to go out and qualify
was some time in the spring of 1959?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember any closer than that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. I just knew it was the spring because that is the time
everyone goes out to fire. It's either going to be warm or it's going to be very
cold when they go out there; it's never in between. I could have said that,
but that was the day I was upset, because this guy kept on badgering me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are talking now about the interview when the Spanish-speaking
agent was present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Which one of them kept badgering you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. The Spanish agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was he badgering you about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He kept on sitting&mdash;he'd been talking, he'd been looking at me,
you know, and doing this [indicating], you know, and he was sitting just
about where this gentleman is now, and I'd been looking out of the corner of
my eye, because I couldn't concentrate on what he was saying because he kept
staring at me, and he was giving me a case of jitters, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have the impression that he didn't believe you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes. But I told him, it's all right in the textbooks, that's fine, you
know, but my theory, my way is you are not going to get anything&mdash;I mean
the majority of the stuff out of books, you have got to apply yourself on the
outside; and he may have gotten an A in Spanish, and may write in&mdash;be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
to decipher anything in Spanish into English, which is fine, as long as he stays
in the lower court, you know, where they are going to speak high Spanish, but
when you go to mingle with the people and speak their language you know,
don't go in there with a college Spanish, because, to begin with, they are going
to tell right off, you know, well, this guy is a highfalutin fellow, you know.
They are not going to have anything to do with him.</p>

<p>You know, common Spanish is quite often overlooked, and that is where
we make our mistake when we go&mdash;I think when we go abroad, because we
try to speak Spanish the way El Camino Real tells you to speak Spanish, and
that is not going to do.</p>

<p>If you come, a fellow comes and tries to be friends with you, and he is giving
you all these thees and thous, first of all you are not going to hit it off right.
Speak like they do. If they say damn; say damn, you know, get with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You and this agent did not strike it off too well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No, I am afraid not. We just spent hours arguing back and
forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We just referred to the El Camino Real that you mentioned,
and you mentioned that that was a Spanish textbook; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. One in which the Castilian Spanish is taught?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us some more about your discussions with Oswald
concerning the Castro movement or the situation in Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. We had quite many discussions regarding Castro. At the time
I was in favor of Castro, I wholeheartedly supported him, and made it known
that I thought he was a pretty good fellow, and that was one of the main things
Oswald and I always hit off so well, we were along the same lines of thought.
Castro at the time showed all possibilities of being a freedom-loving man, a
democratic sort of person, that was going to do away with all tyranny and finally
give the Cuban people a break. But then he turned around and started to purge,
the Russian purge, started executing all these pro-Batistas or anybody associated
with a pro-Batista, just word of mouth. I would say he is a Batista, and right
away they would grab him, give him a kangaroo court and shoot him. He and I
had discussed about that, and right and wrong way that he should have gone
about doing it.</p>

<p>Castro at the time, his brother Raoul was the only known Communist, and
I mentioned the fact that he was a Communist, but that although Castro was
the leader, I doubt if he would follow the Communist line of life, you know.
At the time I don't remember Che Guevra being there. He came in after that.
And we talked how we would like to go to Cuba <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You and Oswald did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. We were going to become officers, you know, enlisted
men. We are dreaming now, right? So we were going to become officers. So
we had a head start, you see. We were getting honorable discharges, while
Morgan&mdash;there was a fellow in Cuba at the time, he got a dishonorable discharge
from the Army, and he went to Castro and fought with Castro in the
Escambres.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. A fellow named Morgan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; Henry Morgan&mdash;not Henry, but it was Morgan, though;
and at the end of the revolution he came out with the rank of major, you know.</p>

<p>So we were all thinking, well, honorable discharge, and I speak Spanish and
he's got his ideas of how a government should be run, you know, the same line
as Castro did at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. So we could go over there and become officers and
lead an expedition to some of these other islands and free them too, you know,
from&mdash;this was really weird, you know, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is what you and Oswald talked about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right, things like that; and how we would go to take over, to
make a republic, you know, because that was another form of Batista, American-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>supported
government, you know. And one of his main, pet peeves was that
he thought that Batista was being supported by the United States, and that
is why we were so against him in the beginning of Castro.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So against Castro?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right, because of the fact that we had lost so much and were
about to lose so much money in Cuba, because now that our man was out.
And we would talk about how we would do away with Trujillo, and things
like that, but never got no farther than the speaking stage. But then when he
started, you know, going along with this, he started actually making plans,
he wanted to know, you know, how to get to Cuba and things like that. I was
shying away from him. He kept on asking me questions like "how can a person
in his category, an English person, get with a Cuban, you know, people, be
part of that revolution movement?"</p>

<p>I told him, to begin with, you have got to be trusted&mdash;right&mdash;in any country
you go to you have got to be trusted, so the best way to be trusted is to know
their language, know their customs, you know; so he started applying himself
to Spanish, he started studying. He bought himself a dictionary, a Spanish-American
dictionary. He would come to me and we would speak in Spanish.
You know, not great sentences but enough. After a while he got to talk to me,
you know, in Spanish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How much of a fluency did Oswald develop in Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He didn't acquire too much. He could, speak a common Spanish,
like "How are you? I am doing fine. Where are you going? Which way is
this?" Common stuff, you know, everyday stuff.</p>

<p>As far as getting in involved political argument, say, or like debate of some
sort, he couldn't hold his own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He couldn't speak Spanish well enough to do something like
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. But as far as meeting the people out in public and asking
for things and telling them something.</p>

<p>And, let's see, what else? Oh, yes, then he kept on asking me about how
about&mdash;how he could go about helping the Castro government. I didn't know
what to tell him, so I told him the best thing that I know was to get in touch
with a Cuban Embassy, you know. But at that time that I told him this we
were on friendly terms with Cuba, you know, so this wasn't no subversive or mal-intent,
you know. I didn't know what to answer him. I told him go see them.</p>

<p>After a while he told me he was in contact with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. With the Cuban Embassy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. And I took it to be just a&mdash;one of his, you know, lies,
you know, saying he was in contact with them, until one time I had the opportunity
to go into his room, I was looking for&mdash;I was going out for the weekend,
I needed a tie, he lent me the tie, and I seen this envelope in his footlocker,
wall-locker, and it was addressed to him, and they had an official seal on it,
and as far as I could recollect that was mail from Los Angeles, and he was
telling me there was a Cuban Consul. And just after he started receiving
these letters&mdash;you see, he would never go out, he'd stay near the post all the
time. He always had money. That's why.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you just say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He always had money, you know, he never spent it. He was
pretty tight.</p>

<p>So then one particular instance, I was in the train station in Santa Ana,
Calif., and Oswald comes in, on a Friday night. I usually make it every Friday
night to Los Angeles and spend the weekend. And he is on the same platform,
so we talked, and he told me he had to see some people in Los Angeles. I
didn't bother questioning him.</p>

<p>We rode into Los Angeles, nothing eventful happened, just small chatter,
and once we got to Los Angeles I went my way and he went his.</p>

<p>I came to find out later on he had come back Saturday. He didn't stay like
we did, you know, come back Sunday night, the last train.</p>

<p>Very seldom did he go out. At one time he went with us down to Tijuana,
Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Before we get into that, tell me all that you can remember
about Oswald's contact with the Cuban Consulate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, like I stated to these FBI men, he had one visitor; after
he started receiving letters he had one visitor. It was a man, because I got the
call from the MP guard shack, and they gave me a call that Oswald had a
visitor at the front gate. This man had to be a civilian, otherwise they would
have let him in. So I had to find somebody to relieve Oswald, who was on
guard, to go down there to visit with this fellow, and they spent about an hour
and a half, 2 hours talking, I guess, and he came back. I don't know who the
man was or what they talked about, but he looked nonchalant about the whole
thing when he came back. He never mentioned who he was, nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long did he talk to him, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. About an hour and a half, 2 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was he supposed to be on duty that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. And he had the guy relieve him, calling me about every
15 minutes, where is his, the relief, where is the relief, you know, because he
had already pulled his tour of duty and Oswald was posted to walk 4 hours and
he only walked about an hour and a half before he received this visitor, you
know, which was an odd time to visit, because it was after 6, and it must have
been close to 10 o'clock when he had that visitor, because anybody, civilian or
otherwise, could get on post up to 9 o'clock at night. After 9 o'clock, if you
are not military you can't get on that post. So it was after 9 o'clock at night
that he had the visitor, it was late at night.</p>

<p>I don't think it could be his brother or father because I never knew that he
had one, you know; in fact the only one I knew was a sick mother, and then
later on, towards the end of our friendship there, he was telling me he was trying
to get a hardship discharge because his mother was sick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never asked Oswald who this fellow was that he talked to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What time did the shifts of duty run? This was a guard
duty that he was on; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did those shifts run?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. They ran, let's see, from 12 to 4, 4 to 8, 8 to 12, 12 to 4, 4 to 8,
like that; and he was roughly on 8-to-10 shift, you know. Must have been
about 9 o'clock when the guy called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The 8-to-12 shift?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; and I had to relieve another guard and put him on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you connect this visit that Oswald had at that time with
the Cuban Consulate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Personally; I did; because I thought it funny for him to be
receiving a caller at such a late date&mdash;time. Also, up to this time he hardly ever
received mail; in fact he very seldom received mail from home, because I made
it a policy, I used to pick up the mail for our hut and distribute it to the guys
in there, and very seldom did I see one for him. But every so often, after he
started to get in contact with these Cuban people, he started getting little
pamphlets and newspapers, and he always got a Russian paper, and I asked him
if it was, you know, a Commie paper&mdash;they let you get away with this in the
Marine Corps in a site like this&mdash;and he said, "No, it's not Communist; it's a
White Russian. To me that was Greek, you know, White Russian, so I guess
he is not a Communist; but he was steady getting that periodical. It was a
newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In the Russian language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And he received that prior to the time he contacted the Cuban
consulate; did he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. And he also started receiving letters, you know, and
no books, maybe pamphlets, you know, little&mdash;like church, things we get from
church, you know, but it wasn't a church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were they written in Spanish, any of them, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Not that I can recall; no.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any reason to believe that these things came to
Oswald from the Cuban consulate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, I took it for granted that they did after I seen the envelope,
you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was on this envelope that made you think that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Something like a Mexican eagle, with a big, impressive seal, you
know. They had different colors on it, red and white; almost looked like our
colors, you know. But I can't recall the seal. I just knew it was in Latin,
United, something like that. I couldn't understand. It was Latin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know for sure whether it was from the Cuban
consulate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. But he had told me prior, just before I found that envelope
in his wall locker, that he was receiving mail from them, and one time
he offered to show it to me, but I wasn't much interested because at the time
we had work to do, and I never did ask to see that paper again, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you what his correspondence with the Cuban consulate
was about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever indicate to you that it had to do with the conversation
that you had about going over to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. The only thing he told me was that right after he had this
conversation with the Cuban people was that he was going to&mdash;once he got out
of the service he was going to Switzerland, he was going to a school, and this
school in Switzerland was supposed to teach him in 2 years&mdash;in 6 months what
it had taken him to learn in psychology over here in 2 years, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you the name of the school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; but he applied for it while in the service, and as far as
I knew, that's where he was going once he got discharged.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This conversation that you and Oswald had about going over
in Cuba and helping Castro was just barracks talk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't seriously <span class="locked">consider&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; but that's when I started getting scared. He started
actually making plans, and how we would go about going to Cuba, you know,
and where we would apply to go to Cuba and the people to contact if we wanted
to go, you know, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you got the impression that he started to get serious about
going to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes. And about this time Castro started changing colors, so
I wasn't too keen on that idea, myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to Oswald about this change in Castro's attitude
and his approach?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. He said that was all due to mal&mdash;bad newspaper reporting,
that we were distorting the true facts, and for the same reason I told
you that, because we were mad, because now we wasn't getting the money
from Cuba that we were before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So Oswald basically took the position that you were getting
a distorted view of Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right; and we weren't getting the true facts of what was happening
in Cuba. We were getting the distorted facts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have no definite way of knowing how much correspondence
Oswald received from the Cuban consulate, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He told you that he had received some correspondence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know whether the Russian newspaper that he got
came from the Cuban consulate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. He was getting that way before he even started corresponding
with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether Oswald ever received any books or
pamphlets or materials in any language other than Russian&mdash;aside from English,
of course?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. He had one book that was English, Das Kapital. I think
it was Russian, a book, like I said. I go by Russian when it's big block letters.
And he had one book like that. He spoke Russian pretty good, so I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How do you understand that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He tried to teach me some Russian. He would put out a
whole phrase, you know. In return for my teaching him Spanish, he would
try to teach me Russian. But it's a tongue twister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't have any understanding of the Russian language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. Basically I wasn't interested in it. In order to learn a
language, I think you have to be motivated. You have to have a desire to use
this language, you know, and I had no need to learn Russian. And just the reverse
of him. He wanted to learn Spanish. He had some idea of using
Spanish later on. I'm sure if this hadn't happened, he probably would be over
there now, if he hadn't been already.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Cuba, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any reason to believe that he has been in Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, a guy like him would find&mdash;would have no difficulty in
getting into Cuba. They would accept him real fast. The fact that he was in
Russia. Now, all these years in Russia, he could have come over to Cuba
and learned some doctrine. That's where he got his ideas to start this Fair
Play for Cuba Committee down in Louisiana. That must have been supported
by Castro.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How do you know that he was involved in the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee in Louisiana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, this was brought out in the newscast at the time of
his arrest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have no direct knowledge of that, though?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. In one of the news pictures I seen him distributing
pamphlets out in the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever see Oswald <span class="locked">after&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After you were discharged from the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You said before that you were in Germany until approximately
the end of 1962; is that correct? December of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never met Oswald at any time while you were in Germany?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. I wanted to&mdash;I knew that he was over there going to
school, and I can't for the life of me recall where I got the scoop that I thought
he was going to some school in Berlin, and I was thinking of going over there,
to see if I could find him, but I never did follow through. There was too much
redtape.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say that you thought he was in Berlin going to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes. For some reason or other. I can't say right now why,
but it just seemed to me that I thought he was going to school there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After you were discharged from the Marine Corps, you learned
that Oswald had gone to the Soviet Union, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I knew he had gone to the Soviet Union before I got discharged.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When were you discharged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. In November. As&mdash;when I got back, I saw the pictures all
over the papers as him having defected, and then we had the investigation
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But even though you had heard before you had gotten out of
the Marine Corps that Oswald had gone to the Soviet Union, while you were in
the Army in Germany you gained the impression that somehow that he was
in Berlin, going to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; in the university there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you don't have any recollection of where you got this idea?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were under the impression, then, that he had left the
Soviet Union?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes. I couldn't&mdash;Oswald loved to travel, right, but if he
couldn't take military life, where everything was told to him, I'm sure he
couldn't take no life in Russia, where he was subjected to strict, you know,
watching. I couldn't picture him living over there. I thought he had gone
to, you know, like I said, the university in Berlin, to study there. He wanted
to study psychology.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think that he was perhaps at the same university that
you spoke of before, that he had applied for when he was in the Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; because I&mdash;the way I understand it, it's&mdash;there's two
big psychologists institutes in Europe. One is in Switzerland. If he was a
devout Communist or pro-Russian, as they say he was&mdash;one was in East Berlin,
and one was in Switzerland&mdash;he couldn't have gone to Switzerland. I knew
he applied for Switzerland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you figured that because he had this interest in psychology,
and since he was interested in communism, he probably wouldn't have gone
to the university in Switzerland, but he might very well have gone to the one
in Berlin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, actually it was on their own level. They would train
him their way.</p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think that Oswald was an agent of the Soviet Union
or was acting as an agent for the Soviet Union at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Whom did you mean to refer to when you said that they would
train him their way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, after he was defecting, I assumed he would take the
Communist way of life, and I would imagine that they would put him to use
to the best of their advantage. But this was later brought out to be false,
because they came out and said that all he did was work in a factory. Whether
or not that's so, I can't say. That's what they said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But at the time you were in Europe, you were speculating
to yourself that he might have been in the Berlin school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You received no particular information? You just figured this
out for yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Just how well do you think Oswald learned to speak Spanish
during the time that he was associated with you in the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He could meet the average people from the streets and hold a
conversation with them. He could make himself understood and be understood.
That's not too clear, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think Oswald was an intelligent person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; I did. More intelligent than I am, and I have a 117,
supposedly, IQ, and he could comprehend things faster and was interested in
things that I wasn't interested in: politics, music, things like that, so much so
like an intellectual. He didn't read poetry or anything like that, but as far as
books and concert music and things like that, he was a great fan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You said before that Oswald was not sufficiently proficient in
Spanish so that he could carry on a political argument or anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did you talk to the FBI about this question of how well
Oswald could speak Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember what you told him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I told him basically the same thing I told you, only then this
fellow came out, this other agent came out with this test he gave me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He gave you a test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Just in speaking to you, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; a written thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He gave you a written test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I told him off the bat, I can't&mdash;my spelling is bad, you know.
I told him right then. But outside of the spelling, I could read it and write it,
you know. So he gave me a test, and he didn't tell me what the outcome was,
but I gathered it wasn't too favorable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What made you gather that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. The sarcasm in his voice when he said, "What makes you think
you speak Spanish so good?"&mdash;after he gave me the test, you know. Well, I
told him, "Your Spanish is all right in its place, you know, college or something
like that, but people have a hard time understanding you," which is true. If
you have any Spanish-speaking fellows working here, let's say, a clerk or something,
well, ask him what the word "peloloso" means, and I would bet you 9
out of 10 times he would not know. That's the Castilian word for "lazy". We
got words for "lazy," three or four of them, "bago," "lento," things like that.
That's one of the things I brought up to him. But he just laughed it off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you tell the FBI that Oswald was so proficient in Spanish
that he would discuss his ideas on socialism in Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't tell them that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are absolutely sure of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; he wouldn't argue with me. All those arguments on socialism
and communism and our way of life and their way of life were held in
English. He talked, but he couldn't hold his own. He would speak three or
four words and then bring it out in English. But as far as basic conversation
and debate; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you tell the FBI agent that Oswald would speak about
socialism and things like that in Spanish and that it seemed to give him a
feeling of superiority to talk about things like that in Spanish in front of the
officers so that the officers couldn't understand him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. We were speaking Spanish. That gave him a sense of superiority,
because they didn't know what we were talking about. In fact, more than
once we were reprimanded for speaking Spanish, because we were not supposed
to do it, and they didn't forbid us to speak Spanish&mdash;now, no political discussions
were talked about. This was small talk when we were talking Spanish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, the FBI report that I have of an interview with you on
December 10, according to this report, 1963, at <span class="locked">Leonardo&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; that's my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This FBI agent says that you told him that Oswald became so
proficient in Spanish that Oswald would discuss his ideas on socialism in
Spanish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He would discuss his ideas, but not anything against our Government
or&mdash;nothing Socialist, mind you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He would speak to me in Spanish in front of the people, in
front of the officers in the ward, what we call the wardroom. Basically the
fact that they could be standing over us and we would be talking, and they
wouldn't understand what we were saying. But no ideas were exchanged, political
ideas were exchanged during those times. Whenever we talked about the
Communist or Socialist way of life, we would do it either in our hut or, you
know, in low whispers doing the <span class="locked">wardroom&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was in in English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. In English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He never spoke of these things in Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; he couldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He didn't know Spanish that well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned one time that you and Oswald and a couple of
other fellows went to Tijuana.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Had Oswald learned the Spanish language at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He knew the Spanish language at that time, because when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
went to the bar, the girls would come along, and I was Spanish&mdash;they knew
that right off the bat, and they would tell me something in Spanish that was
funny, and him and I would laugh, and he would laugh understandingly, and
he would be talking small talk with the girls, you know, which was in my&mdash;you
know, I had taught him just what he knew, and he was very fast learning.
Just like I told the FBI agent that there's a couple of fellows in my outfit
now that wanted to learn, you know, Spanish, and would walk up to me, and
I tried to teach them the best I can. One of them wanted to learn it, because
he was going to Juarez for a problem we had down there, and he used it down
there, what he learned. He learned off of books and also because he asked
me for help for some phrases, and when he went down there he had no trouble.
And the same thing with Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is a fellow that you just referred to now, in your outfit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Jersey?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Jones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Jones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Willie Jones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is his rating?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Specialist 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is he in C Battery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. Delta Battery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What does he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He's a radar operator also. And there's another fellow,
George Bradford, specialist 5. He's asked for it, and I've teached&mdash;taught him
to speak Spanish. In fact, I'll ask him for some money, you know, and he'll
come out and say, "I'm broke right now. I haven't got it with me." Or "Have
you got a cigarette, George?" in Spanish, you know. "No, but I'll get you one,"
or things like that. Now, I met this fellow in Germany, and there I started
teaching him a little bit. Not an awful lot, but smalltalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you say that Bradford and Jones knew about the same
amount of Spanish as Oswald knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Not as much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. They don't know as much as Oswald. Oswald knew more
than they did, because he applied himself more. These guys would pick up a
book once or twice a week and learn a phrase here and there. But Oswald
was continuously trying to learn something, and more often as not he would
come in to me any time we were off, and he would be asking me for this phrase.
Spanish is very tricky. There's some sentences you can use, and if you use
them, let's see&mdash;how can I&mdash;well, the pasts and present, you know, past and
present tense of a sentence. He would get a misinterpretation and say, "I
can't say this in a conversation?", and I would say "No. You don't say this
this particular time. You use it some place else." Like, "Yo voy al teatro"&mdash;"I'm
going to the theatre"&mdash;you know. And there's a correct way of saying
that and there's a wrong way of saying it. The best way&mdash;let me see if I can
get you a good phrase. I can't right offhand think of a phrase that would fit.
But some of these things when he picked up the language, some things he
couldn't put into a sentence right away, and he would want to know why.
That's the type of guy he was. "Why can't these things be used? Why is it
that you use it now and not later?" Things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He would learn some of the words and then he would try to
put them in a sentence logically?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And the language just wasn't constructed that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And he had difficulty in understanding that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. You see, in English you say things straight out; right? In
Spanish, 9 times out of 10 it is just the reverse. I am going to the show. But
if I was to translate it into Spanish, it would come out the show I will go, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
to the show I will go. So you have got to turn it around, you know, for him.
That is what I was trying to explain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He tried to construct Spanish sentences in pretty much the
same way English sentences would be constructed after he learned the Spanish
words?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right; and that is where he got his help from me, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But as far as ordinary, simple ideas, you think that Oswald
could make himself understood in Spanish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you wouldn't, would you, say that he was highly proficient
in the Spanish language, but at least he knew some Spanish phrases and he
could speak some sentences and make his basic ideas known?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. If there is a word, you know, like semiproficient, he wasn't
necessarily low, or was he as high Spanish like I speak, you know; he was
right in the middle. Of course, there would be words, if you taught him, he may
not understand, but basically he understood and made himself understood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember what kind of Spanish dictionary he had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; I don't. It was just regular pocketbook edition, the kind
you buy out there for about $2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know whether Oswald spoke any other language.
You mentioned before he spoke Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think that he was proficient in Russian at that time
or highly proficient?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; I imagine he would be, because he was reading the paper,
and basically if he can read it, you know, I imagine he could speak it also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you hear him speak Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, like I say, he tried to teach me Russian, but then another
time I had some thought that what he was speaking to me was German;
but according to the agent, he messed me all up, and I couldn't figure whether
it was Hebrew or German. I tried to tell him that some of the words he had
mentioned to me at the time I didn't recognize them, but when I came back
from Germany some of those words I do remember, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It seemed to you like it was German?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Like German; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you only came to that conclusion after you had been to
Germany?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. At the time it could have been Yiddish or German, you
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Could it have been Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; different gutteral sounds altogether.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you did not know whether Oswald spoke this other language
to any extent; he just used a few words?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; I just remember his particular language, which I am
in doubt about, had a "ch" gutteral sound to it [indicating], you know; and I
could only assume it was Jewish or German, and later on when I was in
Germany, I think, I am pretty sure it was German that he was speaking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he speak it well or did he just use a few words?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He speaks it like I speak it now, you know, like, just phrases,
you know. Where he picked them up, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you teach anybody else Spanish while you were in the
Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Just one fellow, but he denied that I taught him any Spanish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Don Murray. He took Spanish in college, and we were stationed
in Biloxi, Miss., together, and he would ask me for the same thing. He
tried to construct a sentence in Spanish like you do in English, and it came out
all backwards, and I tried to explain it to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was he stationed with you at Santa Ana too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What makes you say he denied that you taught him any
Spanish?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That is what the agent interviewing me told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The FBI agent told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you say then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I told him that was his prerogative, but I had taught him&mdash;I
mean I had talked to him in Spanish, and he had asked for my help, I assumed
that he wanted to know my association with this thing that is happening now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you get the impression that the agent was trying to get
you to change your story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He was trying to get you to back away from the proposition that
Oswald understood Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, am I allowed to say what I want to say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; I want you to say exactly what you want to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I had the impression now, wholeheartedly, I want to believe that
Oswald did what he was supposed to have done, but I had the impression they
weren't satisfied with my testimony of him not being an expert shot. His Spanish
wasn't proficient where he would be at a tie with the Cuban government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. First of all, you say you got the impression that the FBI agents
that talked to you didn't like the statement that you made about Oswald's inability
to use the rifle well; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What about this Spanish thing, what impression did you get
about the agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, they tried to make me out that I didn't have no authority
to consider myself so fluent in Spanish where I could teach somebody else. That
is there opinion and they can have it as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>If a man comes up to me without knowing a bit of Spanish, if within 6
months&mdash;and I told these FBI men&mdash;he could hold a conversation with me, I
consider myself as being some sort of an authority on teaching, my ability to
teach somebody to speak Spanish, which I told him I could take any man with a
sincere desire to learn Spanish and I could teach him my Spanish, the Spanish
the people speak, you know, I could teach him in, I could have him hold a conversation,
I would say, in 3 months' time he could hold a conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, the FBI tried to indicate to you that you yourself were not
good at Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And did you have any feeling about the FBI agents' attitude
toward Oswald's ability with the Spanish language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; they didn't think he was too well versed, you know, he
didn't know too much Spanish, as much as I wanted them to think he did, you
know. In other words, they felt he could say "I have a dog. My dog is black."
And "I have an automobile," and things like that, you know, basic Spanish, but
I don't teach&mdash;I mean I am not a teacher. I don't go with that, you know. If a
guy wants to learn Spanish, I don't tell him, "Well, let's start off with 'I have a
dog,'" you know. That is no practical use for him, you know.</p>

<p>I tell him, "How do I get to such-and-such a street?" You go to a Spanish fellow&mdash;you
are in Juarez&mdash;and be prepared to receive an answer from him, and he
is going to shoot it to you fast, see, so that's what I teach these guys, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And Oswald was able to ask questions like this and understand
them; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. Now, we had Mexican fellows in our outfit, and Oswald
could understand their Spanish, and made it known to me that he could understand
their Spanish, but in return those Mexicans could not understand my
Spanish because the Puerto Ricans, Cubans, the Dominican Republics, they all
speak real fast. Your Mexican is your Southern equivalent to your Southern
drawl, you know, "You all," and real slow. Well, that is the Mexicans, you
know. And when we speak Spanish to them, Puerto Rican, rather, or Spanish,
they have a hard time understanding you. But he could understand what was
going on, and sometimes he would tell me, "Well, these guys here are planning
a beer bust tonight," he said. "Are you going?" He'd overhear and tell me,
you know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did the FBI agents tell you that Murray had denied that
you had taught him Spanish? Was that when the Spanish-speaking agent was
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Spanish-speaking agent only talked to you once; is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you find that you have to mix English words with your
Spanish to express yourself completely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; what I meant to tell the fellow there&mdash;I think is what that
sentence you have in front of you is&mdash;that, say&mdash;how can I say it?&mdash;you speak
to me in English, and I could say it in Spanish just about as fast as you could
tell me in English, you know, like he is working there, you know, all coming to
his fingertips, like the other fellow was telling me. I could translate that fast,
you know, and deciphering is the only proper way of saying it, you know. And
I made another statement at home, you know, my family was speaking, and the
majority of the words being Spanish, and English just come out, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you speak Spanish around the home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is your wife Puerto Rican?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Does she speak Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was your wife born in Puerto Rico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did she come to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. About 1944, 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How old was she then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. She was about 13.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned that Oswald used to go into Los Angeles with
you from time to time. Can you tell me approximately how many times Oswald
went to Los Angeles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Once he went with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Just once?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Just once. That was, you know, he just stayed a night, as far
as I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that Oswald only went into Los Angeles with you on one
occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That I know; yes. Right after he corresponded with these
people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. With the Cuban Consulate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I assumed he was going there to see somebody. I never asked
him. It wasn't my business, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he later tell you that he had been to the Cuban Consulate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; but I thought it was just his, you know, bragging of some
sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't really believe that he had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, no; I didn't have no interest in it, whether or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you learn that Oswald had gone into Los Angeles on weekends
at other times?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The only thing that you <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That I am sure of was that one particular incident, one particular
time, it struck me as being odd that he had gone out, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that Oswald only went into Los Angeles with you on one
occasion that you can remember; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did the FBI agent ask you about this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; he asked me that, and I believe I gave him the same answer
I have given you now, because the other time they had two men, that other fellow
was asking me questions too, you know, this is back and forth, trying to answer
you, and he is asking me something else, you know. I was sitting in the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
man's office, the commanding officer's office, you know, and I wasn't too at ease
there either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald did not go with you to Los Angeles on every other week
or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No, no. I went every week to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Every week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; every weekend that I was off, you know, roughly three
weekends a month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But Oswald only accompanied you on one occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know of your own knowledge of any other times that
he went into Los Angeles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. The only outstanding thing I can remember was that
Oswald was a casual dresser. By that I mean he would go with a sport shirt,
something like that, and this particular instance he was suited up; white shirt,
dark suit, dark tie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You told the FBI that Oswald enjoyed classical music; is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that he would often talk at length about the opera; is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. I tried to be a listener, but I wasn't too interested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald seem to be interested in girls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; not to my knowledge. He didn't have a girl friend write
him, I know that for a fact; he didn't have no girl writing; never went to a
dance down at the service club; always by himself. And when we had no duty,
him and I used to go to the show, you know, 9 times out of 10 I ended up paying
for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How about sports, did he ever show any interest in sports?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. That is something I would like to bring up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. May I go on the record, because there was a statement I read
in Life Magazine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. And it's erroneous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did it say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. It is quoting a Lieutenant Cupenack, and he made a statement
there in Life, last month, I believe it was. He made a statement saying he was
Oswald's commanding officer, Oswald was on the football team. He was on the
football team, that is the only true fact in the whole statement that he made.
Also that he had a run-in with a captain that was on the football team, and
because of this argument he went off the team.</p>

<p>To begin with, our company commander was a light colonel, lieutenant colonel.
Lieutenant Cupenack was a supply officer. He seldom came in contact with
Oswald, and when he did, it was only when Oswald was on details or when
Lieutenant Cupenack had duty that particular night in the war room when
Oswald was on. And as far as a captain being on the football team, the only
captain we had was in the S-3 section where we worked, and he was too old to
play football.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Cupenack played football. He was good. He was tackle. I
remember I played against him plenty of times myself. And why Oswald left,
I don't know. I don't think he went out, he just bugged out, it's what he
wanted, and he had it for a while, and he just quit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He did come out for football though?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you tell the FBI agents about this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did they ask about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; I didn't tell them. I just couldn't see why a big agency
like Life would not check into the story and let something like this, you know,
get out. I mean it's all well, you know, to go along and believe what the fellow
did, but bring out the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember which article in Life Magazine this was?
Was this the <span class="locked">issue&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. The big writeup on him, the latest one, where he had the picture
of him in the Philippines, and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The one that they had Oswald's picture on the cover, holding
the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. And right now he is an instructor of philosophy or
psychology in Columbia University, I think it is, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This lieutenant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. I just thought it funny, him saying that he was commanding
officer over Oswald; that he had a lot of trouble with Oswald. And
you have been in the Army, a supply officer hardly ever comes in contact with
the troops, and to say that a lieutenant is going to override a lieutenant colonel
is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you tell the FBI that Oswald did not show any interest
in sports?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; I told them he didn't show any interest in sports.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In spite of the fact that he had actually gone on the football
team?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That is just one example, the football. But he never went out
for basketball, baseball, or handball, like the rest of us did, you know. And
myself, I didn't go out for sports either, just football and handball; and that
was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was Oswald a good football player?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Mediocre, he was so-so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What position did he play?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He played tackle or end, you know, never fullback, quarterback
or anything like that, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What kind of football teams were these?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Flag. Flag football.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is, the different companies or batteries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, when Oswald went out for the team, it was in the battery,
getting the lines set up, but he quit before we went for competition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was this regular football or just touch football.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Flag football.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Touch football?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Touch football.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Go back and tell us all that you can remember about this trip
to Tijuana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, it happened on one of our weekends off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When was it, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Oh, you got me there. I would say about May, something like
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. 1959; right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember whether your trip to Tijuana was before
the rifle qualification or after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. After.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How much after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Oh, about 3 to 4 weeks. Within the same month period, because
we were about just gotten paid, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. And these two colored fellows we had in our outfit, I can't
remember their names, like I told the agents, I don't know why because they
worked in a different department than I did there, never had no trouble with
them, they wanted to go down to Tijuana; so I had the car, and they asked me
if I would take them down there. So I told them yeah, they are going to pay
for the gas, so why not, I will go for a free trip. So in the process of getting
ready I asked Oswald if he wanted to go there, you know, and I have asked
him to go to L.A. with me plenty of times and he never bothered going&mdash;I said,
"Oswald, let's go to Tijuana."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
He said, "Okay, fine." Like a casual dresser, he went like the rest of us
were, in casual clothes.</p>

<p>We went down to Tijuana, hit the local spots, drinking and so on, and all
of a sudden he says, "Let's go to the Flamingo." So it didn't register, and I
didn't bother to ask him, "Where is this Flamingo? How did you know about
this place?" I assumed he had been there before, because when we got on
the highway he told me which turns to take to get to this place, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To the Flamingo?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Flamingo, right. And as far as I know it's still there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is this outside of Tijuana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. It's outside of Tijuana. Have you been over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. Well, it's the street before the bullring. You have got
to make a right-hand turn and you go out for about 1 mile, 2 miles out into
the boondocks, the country. It's out in the country, about 2 miles away from
the center of the town.</p>

<p>When we arrived in there, the way the agents tried to ask me if he had
known anybody, I told them no; the way it looked, he just had been there
before, but nobody recognized him. The only things I can remember, like I
told these agents, were the two contrasting bartenders, you know, a real good-looking
woman, amazon; she must have been at least 6-foot tall; and then
there was this fragile-looking fellow behind the bar, one of those funny men,
you know, and outside of being a very nice and exclusive club, you know&mdash;it
wasn't one of these clip joints they had downtown, it was far different from
that; it was really nice, a nice place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The bartender was a homosexual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that apparent to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Oh, yes; it was apparent to us sitting on the bar stool, he looked
like a little kitten; and the other bartender was this big girl. She was a good-looking
doll. And that's about all.</p>

<p>Nothing eventful happened there. There is where the girls were telling
stories, you know. They got these girls, you pick them up there, you know, and
they started telling us stories, and he'd laugh just about the same time I
laughed, and he understood what they were saying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. They spoke Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did anything else happen at the Flamingo that you can
remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; during the night though I had lost my wallet. That was
when I went to the provost marshal&mdash;not the provost marshal&mdash;the M.P. gate,
and reported it, but that is neither here nor there. I had to put in for a new
I.D. card and what have you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was in Tijuana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. In Tijuana.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The shore patrol had an office <span class="locked">across&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right at the border.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Right at the border?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right at the border they have an M.P. shack, right in the
customs office, but they couldn't do nothing, what money I had was gone.</p>

<p>Like I said, these two Negro fellows, they paid for the way back, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did have to put in for a new I.D. card; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you stay in Tijuana itself or did you stay across the border?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; we stayed in downtown Tijuana.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right across the street from the jai-alai games, there are some
hotels, these houses, you know; and as far as I knew, Oswald had a girl. I wasn't
paying too much attention, you know, but it seemed to me like he had one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he show any interest in the jai-alai games?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You stayed over only one night; is that right?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On Sunday you drove back to the base?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald say anything about his trip down there, his experiences,
that you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; it was&mdash;nothing extraordinary was said. The way of life
down there was so poor, you know. They shouldn't allow a town like that to
exist, things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you mention to the FBI the fact that Oswald had a copy
of Das Kapital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned that in your testimony previously too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald have any other books that you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He had Mein Kampf, Hitler's bible, but that was circulating
throughout the battery, everybody got a hold of that one time or another, you
know, and he asked me, how did I know he was reading Das Kapital. I said,
well, the man had the book, and he said that doesn't necessarily mean that
he was reading it.</p>

<p>So I told him in one instance I walked into the room and he was laying the
book down, you know, as he got up to greet me, you know.</p>

<p>He says that still doesn't prove that he was reading it.</p>

<p>Well, if you are sitting, reading a book, and somebody walks into the room,
you are not going to keep on reading the book; you are going to put it down and
greet whoever it is; and then I assume he is going to assume you have been
reading the book, if it is open. It's the only logical explanation.</p>

<p>They didn't want to go for that; they wanted to know did I actually see him
reading the book, which I couldn't unless I sneaked up on the guy, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is the FBI agent you are talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you do remember that when you would walk into the room
Oswald would be sitting there with this book and it would be open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; and then he had this other book. I am still trying to find
out what it is. It's about a farm, and about how all the animals take over and
make the farmer work for them. It's really a weird book, the way he was explaining
it to me, and that struck me kind of funny. But he told me that the
farmer represented the imperialistic world, and the animals were the workers,
symbolizing that they are the socialist people, you know, and that eventually
it will come about that the socialists will have the imperialists working for
them, and things like that, like these animals, these pigs took over and they
were running the whole farm and the farmer was working for them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that what Oswald explained to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you tell the FBI about this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did they know the name of the book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The FBI did not know the name of the book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you want to know the name of the book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It is called the Animal Farm. It is by George Orwell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He didn't tell me. I asked him for the thing, but he wouldn't
tell me. I guess he didn't know. The Animal Farm. Did you read it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Is it really like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; there is only one thing that Oswald did not mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
apparently and that is that the pigs took over the farm, and then they got to
be just like the capitalists were before, they got fighting among themselves,
and there was one big pig who did just the same thing that the capitalist had
done before. Didn't Oswald tell you about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; just that the pigs and animals had revolted and made the
farmer work for them. The Animal Farm. Is that a socialist book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That is just the way you interpret it; right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; I think so. It is actually supposed to be quite an anti-Communist
book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Is it really?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes. You and Oswald finally began to cool off toward each
other a little bit; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did that come about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, like I said, his ideas about Castro kept on persisting in
the same way as at the beginning, when evidence was being shown that Castro
was reverting to a Communist way of government, you know, and secret state,
secret police state, and the turning point came about when there was this one
corporal Batista had in his army, very thin, small fellow, and he had no
significant job whatsoever, he was just a corporal in the army, and because
of the fact that a lady stepped forward at the tribunal and said that this
corporal was in charge of mass murdering all these people, that Batista was
supposed to have done away with, they executed him on the pure fact of one
lady's statement with no proof whatsoever.</p>

<p>So I brought that to his attention and he said, "Well, in all new governments
some errors have to occur, but you can be sure that, something like this was
investigated prior to his execution but you will never know about it because
they won't publicize that hearing," you know.</p>

<p>I couldn't see that, what was happening over there then, when they started
executing these people on just mere word of mouth.</p>

<p>Batista executed them when he had them, a regular blood bath going on
there. But that's when I started cooling off, and he started getting more
reverent toward Castro, he started thinking <span class="locked">higher&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. More highly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; more highly of Castro than I did, and about a month
later I was on leave, and when I came back he was gone. And it must have
been a fast processing, because I wasn't gone over 15 days; when I come back
he was already gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you and Oswald stay in the same hut together until he
actually got out of the Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever put in for a transfer to another hut to get away
from Oswald before you went on leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I did, but it never went through. I was the hut NCO, and
all the other huts had NCO's, and if I went into another hut I would be under
another guy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you didn't want to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; I had my rank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you stayed there and remained NCO in charge of the hut?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; but he never got into arguments with me. He liked to
talk politics with one fellow particularly, Call, and he would argue with him,
and Oswald would get to a point where he would get utterly disgusted with the
discussion and got out of the room. Whenever it got to the point where anger
was going to show, he would stop cold and walk out and leave the conversation
in the air.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He never got mad at anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Not physically mad, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever know him to get into a fight with anybody at
Santa Ana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say you did put in for a transfer to another hut; is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that permission granted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I was waiting for it to be granted. I turned it in to the section
sergeant, and I never knew what the outcome was. I never found out.
They never notified me as to why I wanted to get transferred to the other
huts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never did move from your hut to another hut?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You actually were discharged, from the Marines before this
question of your transfer ever came up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you go into the Marines? You told us before. Let
us review that for a moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I went into the Marines November 1, 1956.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were discharged 1 November, <span class="locked">approximately&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. 1959; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you go on leave prior to your discharge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Terminal leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it a terminal leave, and you just took your leave and left,
or did you go on leave and then come back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. I went on leave and then came back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you go on leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. About in August, I think&mdash;September to October, something like
that. A 15-day leave, to go to California. August or September. I think it
was in the latter part of the summer. I always take that part to come into
New York, but when I came back, Oz was gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you go on leave: to California, or did you come
back to New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. To New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to the FBI just about this series of events?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember what you told them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I told them that I had gone on leave, and when I came back
Oswald had been discharged and that then they came out with the story that
he defected, I think, then, and that we all had gone under investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you tell the FBI agents when you went on leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes. I gave them a specific date. I think I told them about
August.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't tell them June or July?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No, I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Could you have told them it was June or July?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I may have told them June or July. I'm not too sure. I know
it was the midsummer; because I came into New York in the good weather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you tell the FBI agents that you had actually transferred
to another hut?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't tell them that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are positive of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; but I told them that Oswald was transferred. The only
transfer that occurred was Oswald to my hut, and that I put in for a transfer,
and transfer was waiting to be approved for an NCO to be bumped into my
hut, but it never got approved. I guess things came up, and about 2 or 3
weeks later I went on leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you came back from leave, Oswald was gone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes. Prior to my leaving I knew he was putting in for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
hardship discharge because he had gone to see the old man and so forth and
so on, but, like I say, it usually took so long time to get a hardship discharge,
too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you and Oswald were actually quartered in the same quonset
hut up to the time Oswald was discharged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Up to the time I went on leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And when you came back Oswald was gone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never saw him after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald say anything to you while you were in the Marines
together about going to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He never did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; I couldn't understand where he got the money to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You said before he didn't spend very much money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; but I imagine the way it costs now, it costs at least $800
to a $1,000 to travel across Europe, plus the red tape you have to go through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you see this official-looking envelope that you mentioned
before with the seal on it? Do you remember when that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Outside of being prior to one of my departures for Los Angeles&mdash;the
month, you want?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; if you can remember it. I mean, was <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. It's hard to say, because we were together so long. It was one
of the weekends I was going into Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember whether it was before or after your rifle
practice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; It was after, because prior to our rifle practice I don't think
we had any political discussions at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Most of those were after the rifle qualifications?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; you see, this all happened, oh, between when I say, May to
September or May to August, of going on leave, all these incidents, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember how long you were back at Santa Ana after
your leave before you were discharged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. About 2 months, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did the FBI agents ask you about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned this fellow by the name of Call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Richard Call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was he in your quonset hut?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; he was in our company. He was in a different quonset hut.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was he a friend of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Semifriendly. I know personally that he used to call Oswald
Oswaldovich or Comrade. We all called him Comrade, which is German for
friend. We didn't put no communistic influence whatsoever. But then he made
the statement saying, no, he never called Oswald "Comrade," or anything like
that, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. The FBI agent told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The FBI agent told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You just mentioned the term "Oswaldovich"; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; he asked me if anyone had called him Oswaldovich. No.
Comrade commissar; yes. We all used to kid around that language. He used to
like it, and he would come out, we would call him "comrade," and he would go
straight, jack up and give a big impression. But Call said he didn't. Well,
that's his prerogative. He didn't want to get mixed up in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you are pretty sure you never heard him call him
Oswaldovich?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who is Private, First Class Wald? Was he in your hut, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He was in our outfit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And was he a friend of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Just speaking acquaintances. That's all. He didn't have too
many close friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Oswald. And these guys were all different, like Wald was a
good example. He was a sportsman. So was Osborne. He was going strictly
for sports. And Call was the closest you would come to Oswald, because he
liked classical music and good books, now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But Wald and Osborne, they were more interested in sports
and that sort of thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What about Sergeant Funk? Did you mention him to the
FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; Sergeant Funk wasn't in our outfit too long to know
Oswald. Oswald and him didn't hit it off at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did that come about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, one instance was when we were all standing formation,
waiting for work call. We were off this day. And Call and some other fellows
were all around there, you know, making like they were, you know, shooting
their guns off, you know, just playing around. So it just happens, when Funk
came out Oswald was the only one doing it. So they grabbed Oswald and made
him march with a full field pack around the football field in the area. And he
bitched when he pulled that tour of duty, and it stuck in my mind, because it's
the first time since basic that I seen that happen. But it happened when Funk
stepped out, Oswald the first one he seen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald complain about Funk after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He had nothing to do with him. Always tried to find fault.
The man had a lot of faults. He was very sloppy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Funk. And he had a tendency to&mdash;he was very&mdash;very bad
leader, in my opinion, because NCO's in the Marine Corps, you carry a sword,
and we loved to see him carry a sword, because when you salute him, he brings
the sword up to here (indicating) like this, and one of these days it's going to
happen, because the blade would be swinging next to his ear, and we're all
waiting for that thing to happen. That's what I remember about Funk. He
wasn't there too long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know any of the other fellows in the outfit who might
have known Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. There was one sergeant I was trying to think of, but I
couldn't think of his name. I think I gave a name to the FBI agents, Holbrook
or&mdash;something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember a Corporal Botelho?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes. Botelho. He was from upstate California, a potato
rancher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was his relationship with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. The same as the rest of the fellows: Not too close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever have any arguments with any of these people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes. Quite frequently he had arguments, but Botelho usually
would have arguments about, well, Botelho was pretty proud about his car,
you know, and Oswald would find some fault in it, not the right make&mdash;he had
a Chevy, a 1956 Chevy, and one time I walked in on the discussion. I didn't
know what it was about. And they were pretty mad at each other. And, as
I said, Oswald just took off. But Botelho was a pretty quiet fellow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What about Private, First Class Roussel? Do you remember
mentioning him to the FBI agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Roussel? Yes. He was a sports enthusiast. A little, short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
fellow from Louisiana. In fact, I took him home when I got discharged from
the Marine Corps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What rank was Call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. At the time&mdash;at the time when Oswald was in the outfit, he
was corporal. But then later on he got promoted to a sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was your rank when you were discharged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Corporal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Private.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Just a straight private?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever complain about the fact that he hadn't been
promoted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No, never. Never. I don't guess he expected it. I knew he was
court-martialed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. I got that from the scuttlebutt, one of the guys who knew
him from overseas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you hear what he was court-martialed for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. After all this came out later, I read about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is the silent area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That's what I referred to. He put silent area. That's the war
room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He, you mean the FBI agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is where you actually worked in <span class="locked">watching&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Watching the scopes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. According to the FBI agent's notes, you and Oswald were passing
notes back and forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. We worked in a room similar to this, and there would be a big
plotting board there with the aircraft in flight, and radar sets would be back
there, with the officers back there, and he and I, when we weren't watching the
scopes, we would be writing down what aircraft were up, and we had a small
lamp on our table. So when we wanted to talk, he would hand a note to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were not permitted to talk during this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. The enlisted men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The enlisted men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, the enlisted men were permitted to talk, but not at this
table. The only ones permitted to talk were the controllers who had the aircraft
on their scopes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your job was to watch one of the scopes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Watch one of the scopes, and when we were relieved from doing
that, we sat on the front table and kept track of the aircraft on the plotting
board.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So while you were actually watching the scope, you were permitted
to speak? You had to talk at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes, to the aircraft.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To keep track of the aircraft?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes. That's why they didn't want too much noise in there.
Just enough for the controller to understand the pilot and vice versa.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There are two of these FBI reports here that tell me that you
told the FBI that Oswald used to go to Los Angeles every 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I used to go to Los Angeles every other week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But not Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you are sure that you told that to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have no question about that at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No question about that at all. Otherwise I wouldn't have made
the statement that he had been with me one time. It would have been common
to see him in the train station. But it wasn't.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember Lieutenant Depadro?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He was a first lieutenant. He was from Florida. His parents
were boatbuilders. He owned&mdash;his family owned a big boatbuilding place in
Florida. I couldn't tell the agents what town. I wouldn't remember that. I
thought it was a town, I gave <span class="locked">them&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He was just a section officer. He worked as a controller, and
he was also our platoon officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The FBI report indicates that you have told Lieutenant Depadro
that Oswald was receiving Russian language newspapers; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes. I mentioned that to him on the way from the guard shack
at one time, and he just brushed it off. He didn't seem to care.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who is Sergeant Lusk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Our sergeant major.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember talking to the FBI agents about Sergeant
Lusk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you tell them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I told them that in one instance Sergeant Lusk had the misfortune
of waking us up in the morning. Nobody bothered waking us up, and the
formation had gathered, and we were all sleeping away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The men in your quonset hut?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. And I'm the one in charge of them, and about 8 o'clock
in the morning I hear the door open up, and I see this guy walking into my room.
The first thing I wake up and see was the diamond, the stripes, and he says,
"I want to see you men in the old man's office, in class A's." So I knew it was
a bad step. We went up there, and he chewed us out for sleeping. And on the
way back he said, "You're getting as bad as Oz."</p>

<p>But it wasn't our fault. It wasn't Oswald's fault. He slept away with the
rest of us. It was too far for the CQ. And he just didn't feel like walking that
far. So I told the agents that I was the only corporal on restriction at the same
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. They restricted your barracks for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. Well, it's better to be restricted than to be court-martialed
for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It is. Do you remember discussing extradition treaties with
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was that discussion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Any crime perpetrated in the States, say somebody was to do
something wrong in the United States, and they wanted to get him. We talked
about countries he could go to. I said, well, not including Cuba, which at that
time would take anybody, and Russia, he could go to Argentina, which I understand
is extradition-free. But the other countries all have treaties with the
United States. They would get you back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In that discussion what did Oswald say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Nothing that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he say he would go to Argentina if he ever got in trouble
like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. If he ever got in trouble; yes. But this is the period of time
we are talking about, of taking over the Dominican Republic. And this is what
I don't understand: Oswald brought out a fact about a route to take to go to
Russia, bypassing all U.S. censorship, like if you wanted to get out without being
worried about being picked up. And he definitely said Mexico to Cuba to Russia,
and whether or not I'm bringing into the fact these two guys that defected.
But that was the same route. And he told me about the two guys, the same way
these two guys defected.</p>

<p>Now, I can't imagine who he meant. I thought he was referring to this later
case. But the FBI agent confused me all to heck. He told me it was a year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
later that these two guys from the United States, working for the mathematicians,
something like that, defected, taking the same route that Oswald had told
me about. I remember him explaining to me, and he had drawn out a regular
little map on a scratch paper showing just how you go about doing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald did this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your recollection is that he mentioned two men who also defected
to Russia at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. The same route; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But the FBI man said that didn't happen until a year afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. A year later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you checked up on this to find out when these men did
defect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. I took it for granted they had the scoop, you know. I
assume that I may have been interpreting these events and running the two
together. But in my estimation I don't think it was possible. I remember him
at the time mentioning two men that had defected, and we were wondering how
they got there, and he said this is how he would get there, now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he say these two men had gone from the United States into
Mexico into Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He said, "This is the route they took. This is the way I would
go about it. This is the way they apparently did it." Something to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your recollection isn't too clear on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you do recall that Oswald mentioned that if he were
going to go to Russia, that he would go to Mexico and then to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, you read in the newspapers after the assassination that
Oswald went to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; that he was in Mexico for a while on vacation or something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you read in the newspaper that Oswald had gone to Mexico
with the idea in mind of going on to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You had never read that in the newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't know that before now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; outside of him being in Russia, and he went to Mexico on
his own. From Texas I think he went to Mexico. And I didn't know him to
cross over into Cuba.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, now, I am not saying that he actually went to Cuba.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Or had <span class="locked">any&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I am saying he went to Mexico with the intention of going to
Cuba.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I didn't read that far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't read that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So there is no chance that you read this later and are confusing
this as something that Oswald said before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. This was definitely said then, in 1959, and according to
the FBI records this supposed same route or near to the same route was done
in 1960 or 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you and Oswald ever talk about religion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He was&mdash;he didn't believe in God. He's a devout atheist. That's
the only thing he and I didn't discuss, because he knew I was religious.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He knew that you are religious?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are religious?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, to the effect that I believe there is a God or a Maker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You attend church regularly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; and in one instance he told me that God was a myth or
a legend, that basically our whole life is built around this one falsehood, and
things like that. I didn't like that kind of talk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember anything else that he said about religion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; outside of condemning anything that had to do with religion,
you know. He laughed. He used to laugh at Sunday school, you know,
mimic the guys that fell out to go to church on Sundays. He himself never went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever quote from the Bible or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever make fun of the Bible?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. It was just being a good book, written by a few men, you
know, that had gotten together and wrote up a novel. That's all. Outside of
being a well-written book, there's no fact to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But he didn't quote sections from the Bible just to show how
wrong it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to the FBI men about this question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. I don't think I did. They asked me about religion, and I
told them he was an atheist. That's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't remember telling them that Oswald used to quote
from the Bible and show you how wrong it was and tried to make it look silly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. That was typical of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you have no recollection of him doing that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any recollection of telling the FBI men he did that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, this question of socialism, discussions of socialism that
you had with Oswald: Did he compare that with the military life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he say about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, this is&mdash;military life is the closest to the Socialist way
of life, where you had&mdash;let's see. How did he phrase it&mdash;everything was common
or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald seem to think that socialism would be a good
thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That's right, for people. If they worked for the military, they
could work for everybody, instead of everybody being an individualist and just
a few of them having&mdash;if they all got together in one common denominator,
if everybody worked with the state owning everything, and everybody worked
for the state.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald didn't really like the Marine Corps, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How could he say that socialism was like the military, and
like socialism, and still hate the military?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He liked the life but hated the military. Some people love to
be bossed around, you know, and told what to do. Yet, the same people may
not like for certain individuals, let's say like Sergeant Funk, for instance, to
tell them what to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever have the feeling that Oswald disliked discipline
as a general proposition, or just individual people that told him what to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I would say discipline by certain individuals, you know. He
used to take orders from a few people there without no trouble at all. Just
a few people that didn't like him or he didn't like them, or he thought to be&mdash;he
thought Funk to be too stupid to give him any kind of order. That was
beyond his level. That was fact. This man was a complete moron, according
to Oswald. Why should he, because he's been longer, have the authority to
give him orders, you know? So he had no respect for him. If he had respect,
he would follow, go along with you. But if he thought you to be inferior to
him or mentally&mdash;mental idiot, he wouldn't like anything you told him to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember any other discussions about this comparison
of socialism with the Marine Corps or the military?</p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>(Question read.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Well, according to the point where he would bring out that
the military, there was always one boss, and if he tells everybody to do something,
they all do it with no question, and everything runs along smoothly.
But in our government, no one person could give that order where the whole
populace would obey or act to it. There were a whole bunch of individualists.
Some may, some won't, and some would argue about it. That's not the same
exact word he used, but <span class="locked">that's&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He indicated that he thought it was a good thing that somebody
should give orders like this <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. That everybody would obey without question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you surprised when you learned that Oswald had gone
to the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You had no reason to <span class="locked">believe&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. From your association with him that he was intending to do
any such thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. While he was in the Marine Corps; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He never spoke to you or indicated to you in any way that he
planned to go to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You thought he was going, as you mentioned <span class="locked">before&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. To Switzerland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To school in Switzerland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are absolutely certain that you did not indicate to the
FBI that Oswald accompanied you to Los Angeles as a regular matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You just told them he went with you once?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In connection with this discussion of extradition treaties, did
Oswald say that he would go to Russia if he ever got into any trouble? Do
you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He had mentioned Russia as a place of refuge if he ever got into
any trouble, but the answers went around to the other countries, well, I would
say, "excluding Russia or Cuba, Argentina would be the next best."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you didn't get any impression from him that he intended
to go to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was just a general discussion of extradition treaties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Just general conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This Pfc, <span class="locked">Roussel&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Henry R. Roussel, Jr.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He was from New Orleans, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No. Baton Rouge, Louisiana, right outside of LSU.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Roussel was from Baton Rouge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember discussing Roussel with the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember telling them where he was from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you tell them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Baton Rouge. On account of he had taken us to the LSU, you
know, university&mdash;campus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is when you were at Biloxi?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; this is at the terminal when we got discharged. Roussel
was on leave. I was discharged. I took Call&mdash;Call was discharged also, and
Call and myself and Roussel and another two or three&mdash;two other guys, we
made a trip to the east coast, but we went down to the South to take Roussel
home. And I remember it well, because it was the year Billy Cannon was
famous down there at the LSU.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't tell the FBI that Roussel was from New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember this Pfc. Murray? What is his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Don.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Don?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Don.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember him as knowing Spanish to about the same
extent that Oswald knew Spanish, or more or less? What is your recollection
on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He knew less than Oswald did when Oswald&mdash;the last time I
seen Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How would you describe Murray's command of Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Not too good. In his particular instance it was phrases, you
know, that kind of talk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that you weren't as successful in your attempts to <span class="locked">teach&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I didn't have the time. See, when we were in Biloxi, we were
both together, going to school there. But we didn't have the time once we got
to California. He was living off post. His wife was there, so we didn't have
that much time together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Murray move off post right away, or did he live on the post
for a while after he came <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He lived about&mdash;after I got there, about 2 months, and then
his wife&mdash;he went to Florida and got married and brought his wife in to California.
I would say he moved off post about February of 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did most of the marines call Oswald? Did they call him
Lee <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald, just by his last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Just Os or Oswald. Very seldom do you find in the military,
at least I haven't come in contact with, where one fellow referred to another
fellow by the first name. It's always by the last name, mainly because the
name is written on his jacket, you know. I didn't even know his name was Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't know that his first name was Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you say that you, concerning your contact with Murray,
just taught him a few phrases or answered questions when he asked you questions
about Spanish, or would you say that you engaged in any kind of real
program to teach him Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; just answer some questions he had or phrases that he
wanted interpreted, that's it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember a fellow by the name of Charley Brown in
your outfit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Charley Brown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; that is a name I gave him. I believe it was one of the
fellows that was in the barracks with us at one time or another, Charley Brown,
but I can't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That doesn't ring a bell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you mention the name of Charley Brown to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. I may have. We got a Charley Brown in our outfit now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; but I may have, may not have mentioned Charley Brown.
I gave them the name of who I thought&mdash;felt who the one or two colored fellows
were, but I couldn't think of it, and just made a stab in the dark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't remember what the name was that you told the FBI
now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; Walt, Walt&mdash;Watts, that is the name I gave him, not
Brown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of anything else about Oswald that you think
might be of some help to the Commission in its investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He didn't like the immediate people over him in this particular
outfit. All of them weren't as intelligent as he was in his estimation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What about your estimation, did you think that they were as
smart as Oswald was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Oswald, I remember, for instance, that Oswald used to get in
heated discussions with a couple of the officers there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Right. And they'd be talking about, let's say, politics, which
came up quite frequently during a break, let's say, and I would say out of the
conversation Oswald had them stumped about four out of five times. They just
ran out of words, they couldn't come back, you know. And every time this
happened, it made him feel twice as good, you know. He thought himself quite
proficient with current events and politics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He used to enjoy doing this to the others, I could imagine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He used to cut up anybody that was high ranking, he used to
cut up and make himself come out top dog. That's why whenever he got in
a conversation that wasn't going his way he would get mad, he'd just walk off,
you know, and leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of anything else about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He didn't drink. He didn't drink too much. Occasional beer.
I never seen him drunk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any reason to think that he had any homosexual
tendencies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; never once. It was odd that he wouldn't go out with girls,
but never once did he show any indications of being that. In fact we had two
fellows in our outfit that were caught at it, and he thought it was kind of disgusting
that they were in the same outfit with us, and that is also in the records
of the outfit, these two fellows they caught.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever tell you why he wasn't interested in girls or did
you ever discuss that with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; I figured this fellow here looked to me like he was studying
and applying himself for a goal, he wanted to become somebody, you know
what I mean; later on, after he reached that goal, he will go and get married,
or something like that; but the time I knew him he was more or less interested
in reading and finding out different ideas here and there. That is, he'd
ask what we thought of a current crisis, you know, and he'd argue that point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He was a pretty serious-minded fellow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. Yes; he was. Very seldom clowned around, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think he had much of a sense of humor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. No; he didn't appreciate it. You couldn't pull a practical joke
on him, very sarcastic sneer all the time, you know. He had only one bad characteristic,
one thing that can really identify him was a quirk he had. I don't
know what it was, when he spoke, the side of his face would sink in and cause
a hollow and he'd kind of speak through open lips like that, you know, and
that's the only thing you could remember about Oswald when he spoke, you
know, something like that, you know [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever think that he was mentally unbalanced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delgado</span>. He never got real mad where he'd show any ravings of any
sort, you know. He controlled himself pretty good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If you can't remember anything else about Oswald, I have
no more questions. On behalf of the Commission I want to thank you very
much.</p>

<h2 id="t266"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_DANIEL_PATRICK_POWERS" id="TESTIMONY_OF_DANIEL_PATRICK_POWERS">TESTIMONY OF DANIEL PATRICK POWERS</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Daniel Patrick Powers was taken on May 1, 1964, at U.S.
Courthouse, Chicago, Ill., by Mr. Albert E. Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of
the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Daniel Patrick Powers, called as a witness herein, having been first duly
sworn, was examined, and testified as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This young man is Daniel Patrick Powers. He lives at 401
12th Avenue West, Menomonie, Wis. Did I correctly state those facts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Powers, I have given you what supplements my telephone
conversation earlier in the week, Mr. Rankin's letter&mdash;he is general counsel
for the Commission&mdash;advising you of the creation of the Commission and
enclosing the Joint Resolution No. 137, which is a resolution authorizing the
creation of the Commission; and President Johnson's Executive Order No.
11130, which did create the Commission; and then the rules and regulations
of the Commission itself for the taking of depositions.</p>

<p>And from those papers and my conversation with you earlier, you are aware,
are you not, that the Commission has been enjoined and has the duty of investigating
the facts and circumstances surrounding and involved in the assassination
of our late President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. We have been interviewing
a number of witnesses, persons who, by pure happenstance, had some
contact with some of the people involved, who became involved in that tragic
event.</p>

<p>One of those persons is a man by the name of Lee Harvey Oswald. It is
our information that you had some contact with him while you were in the
Armed Forces of the United States, and I would like to ask you a few questions
if I might. You are an ex-service man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were a member of the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your number was 1497089.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. 1497089; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the dates of your service, according to our records, are
December 18, 1954&mdash;that's wrong, or am I right? You entered the Reserves
of the Marines in December 18, 1954, and served in active duty in the Marines
November 1, 1956 to October 1, 1958?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that all correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think it will be well if you start out by telling us what and
who you are right at the moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. At the moment, presently I'm teaching at the Menomonie
Public School System in Wisconsin, and I'm teaching physical education with
the additional duties of head football and wrestling coach.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you are a married man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And with a family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Of two children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Two children. And you're a native-born American?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's also correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I was born in Minneapolis, Minn. Actually, I believe my birth
certificate says Minneapolis, Minn.; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Mrs. Powers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Was born in St. Paul, Minn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, during your service in the Marines, did you become acquainted
with a man&mdash;fellow marine, known as Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you recall him now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you&mdash;when did that acquaintance first arise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. To the best of my recollection, this acquaintance first arose when
I was en route to Jacksonville&mdash;rather from Jacksonville, Fla., to Biloxi, Miss.;
attended school there, and he was a member of the group that was&mdash;we were
traveling together, and was a senior marine in charge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you the senior marine in charge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your rank at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. At that time my rank was private first class.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I have the travel orders, and if you want <span class="locked">them&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fine. If you have anything from which you may refresh your
recollection so that we can have the exact date. I appreciate it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. This would be, 2 May 1957 is on the date of these orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May 2, 1957?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's correct. We were authorized to proceed to Shipping
and Receiving Station, <span class="locked">Keesler&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Check that over again and see if in fact it's the 2d of May 1956.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I'm sorry, 2d of May 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1957?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>"Effective 3 May 1957, the below listed marines are directed to report to the
3380th Technical Training Group, 3383d Student Squadron, Block 21, Building
17, Shipping and Receiving Section, Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Miss., for
duty under instruction, USNAC&amp;W Operators Course No. AB27037, Class 08057,
for a period of about 6 weeks. Upon arrival thereat, they will report to the
Commanding Officer for duty."</p>

<p>And then it lists six marines with Lee H. Oswald as one of these marines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now. I'm pleased that you have those orders because
an FBI report fixes that time as&mdash;in the interview they had with you as you
having reported to have been in June of 1956, and in fact it was May 2, 1957?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's correct, sir. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have been a little curious as to why you hadn't met him while
you were at the Naval Air Technical Center at Jacksonville, Fla. I mean
previous to this May 2d order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. There is a possibility, sir; that I had met him, but he doesn't
enter into my recollection until this particular period of time. Now, in recalling
Jacksonville, Fla., going to school there, the only individual that stands out in
my mind, or individuals that were directly concerned with me are the people
that I was associated with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. But as far as he was not in this particular social group, if you
would like to call it that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He also was a private, first class at that time, was he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I don't believe he was, sir. I believe he was a private. I'll
go back to these orders and substantiate that. Yes; that's correct. He was
a private, first class, at that particular time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you give me the names of&mdash;this was a group in which
you were the senior and you were in charge of the travel of your group from the
Naval Air Technical Center in Jacksonville, Fla., <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. <span class="locked">Keesler&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is spelled K-e-e-s-l-e-r, Keesler Field, in Mississippi, Biloxi?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And who were the others?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. There is a Pfc. Edward J. Bandoni.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have his number there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Read it, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. 1551427. Pfc. James N. Brereton, 1644586; Pfc. Donald P.
Camarata, 1632342.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Would you check that number again as against
mine? I had 1653230, am I in error?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. You're in error, sir. It's 1632342. The next name that appears
is Lee H. Oswald, private, first class, 1653230. And the next name is my
name, Powers, Daniel P., 1497089. And the next name that appears is Schrand,
Martin E., private, first class, 1639694.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is spelled S-c-h-a-r-a-n-d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. A-n-d, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, -r-a-n-d. Or just Schand, is it? Spell it, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. S-c-h-r-a-n-d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. I want to get that straight because we do have an
incident that occurred with respect to him that I want to ask you about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, sir. It did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Those are all the men. Now, were you fellows destined to be
together pretty much as a group from that point on for some time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. How do you mean "destined"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it turn out that the five of you&mdash;your assignments from
then on were&mdash;ran relatively parallel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Up to&mdash;you could say that's true to a certain extent. We did
attend school there. Then from Mississippi we were assigned orders to go
overseas, and report to El Toro, Calif. Here, while we were at Mississippi, it
was parallel. We attended the same classes, and in the same particular group
as far as the initial starting of training and graduation, if you would like
to call it that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. And then once we got to California, they changed somewhat
because some of the people reported in early to California and some of them
reported later, so this getting into an overseas draft meant that some were
leaving out of California earlier than others, of course, which would mean their
assignments as far as orders, were different.</p>

<p>I would say that four of the names mentioned previously, Camarata, Oswald,
Powers, and Schrand, went to the Far East; Bandoni and Brereton, I'm not
sure where they went. I think they went to the east coast, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your first impression of Oswald when you traveled
from Jacksonville, Fla., to Biloxi, and Keesler Field, in Mississippi?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Well, my first impression of this individual is that he was
somewhat, to use the term, "loner." He was an individual who was normally
outside the particular group of marines that were in this attachment to
Keesler.</p>

<p>I felt that he was a somewhat younger individual, less matured than the
other boys. Again, this was just a personal opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, what is your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. My age at the moment is 27.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. And what is the date of your birth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. July 20, 1936. At that particular time I believe I <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you were 3 years older than Oswald. He was born October 18,
1939?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did any incident occur during your travel from the Naval Air
Base in Jacksonville to Keesler Field in Biloxi, Miss., with respect to Oswald
which arrested your attention or was there any question about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or was this relatively uneventful?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. It was uneventful, you might say. There is nothing that you
would care to attach any significance to other than to the fact that for the most
of us, this was the first time that we ever were on a train and this was somewhat
a new experience for the most part for most of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. And how many days travel were you given?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I believe it was an overnight travel. So it probably&mdash;2 days,
May 3 to May 4, is when we actually reported in here; departed Jacksonville,
Fla., on 2 May 1957 and arrived in Biloxi, Miss., 4 May. So we reported for
duty on that particular day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you were then there May 4, 1957?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the nature of your training, and then after that, give
his training, in Keesler Field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. The nature of my training was to be trained in the operation
of radar equipment which was used to guide or locate aircraft in the air.
His training was completely parallel to mine. It was similar; it was the same
in context.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that likewise true of these other men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's also correct, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your assignments from day to day were relatively parallel
then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I would think they were exactly parallel as far as attending
classes. We went to the same classes, we were at the same level of instruction
throughout the whole school. I mean we were brought right along. Some were
above the others, and in retention of what they were learning; we still were
similar, I would say exact in the classes that we did attend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These were in general&mdash;this was aircraft control and warning
operator course?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's correct, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it included the classes of uses of radar and other aircraft
warning devices?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you awarded the&mdash;what is known as the M.O.S., Military
Occupation Specialty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; we were. I believe coming out of&mdash;excuse me&mdash;coming out
of Jacksonville, Fla., we were given a general M.O.S. of 6700, and then <span class="locked">after&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Explain what that means to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. M.O.S. is a Military Occupational Specialty, and all it does is
categorize you as to what you are going to fall in when they issue you orders;
and 6700 is aircraft, as I understand; my memory may be somewhat faded or
dim.</p>

<p>And when we did come out of Keesler, then we were added the additional
digit of 47 which would make us a ground&mdash;I better not say "ground control,"
radar operator for&mdash;as a guess, I would call it an early warning system.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how long did you boys remain at Keesler?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Exact dates would be from 4 May to 4 June 1957, is when we
picked up our orders to go to California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's a month from the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I'm sorry. It says here, "You will stand transferred June 19,
1957, and you will report to your temporary duty station at 12 July 1957."
This is when we were&mdash;2400 hours&mdash;we were supposed to report in the temporary
duty station, which was El Toro, Calif.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you boys travel out to El Toro?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. From 19 June to 12 July 1957. This was somewhat blurred here.
16 days delay and 4 days travel by commercial. So it would be&mdash;June is 30&mdash;it
would be 11 and 12, which would be <span class="locked">20&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 16 days. 11 and 12, that would be 23 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; so actually it must be 19 days and 4 days travel by commercial
carrier. 14 days&mdash;rather 19 days' delay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you boys travel out to El Toro?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No; we did not. Most of us went on leave from there to&mdash;rather
from Mississippi to our homes and spent time there, and then proceeded to
California by commercial vehicle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And were you living in Minneapolis at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No; I was not. My leave address, Rural Route No. 2, Owatonna,
Minn. That was my parents' home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any recollection of Oswald while he was at Keesler?
That is, did he continue to be&mdash;you used the term "loner"&mdash;was he a loner while
he was at Keesler Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I would say yes and no. A "loner" is a real poor term to use.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I think that he was an individual that found it hard to come in
close relationship to any one individual, and I don't say that he was one that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
did try to avoid it, but it seems like almost he was always striving for a relationship,
but whenever he did come, he would get into the group or something that
his&mdash;that his&mdash;just his general personality would alienate the group against him.</p>

<p>And to me, he was an individual that&mdash;an individual that could come to a
point that I don't&mdash;that he would come to a point in his life where he would
have to face a decision, now, this is just again a personal opinion; he had a
large homosexual tendency, as far as I was concerned, and, well, maybe not
these tendencies, but a lot of feminine characteristics as far as the other individuals
of the group were concerned, and I think possibly he was an individual
that would come to a point in his life that would have to decide one way
or the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. On a homosexual or leading a normal life, and again, now, this
is a personal opinion.</p>

<p>And I think this, more than any other factor, was the reason that he was on
the outside of the group in this particular group that we were in there in
Mississippi.</p>

<p>He was always an individual that was regarded as a meek person, one that
you wouldn't have to worry about as far as the leadership was concerned, a challenge
for leadership or anything.</p>

<p>He could easily be led, an individual that was influenced I think by education,
and was impressed by a person who had some education, an intelligent
individual.</p>

<p>He had the name of Ozzie Rabbit, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Ozzie Rabbit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Ozzie Rabbit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; now, this goes back to what I had said before that he was
the meek mild individual that a person felt if he had something, that he
wouldn't really fight to keep it. He would take the easy way out to avoid conflict.
But then again, I'm trying to recall this in my mind, and I'm not sure
whether something&mdash;whether it is something that is really true or something
that I want to <span class="locked">recall&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, I would <span class="locked">like&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. About him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In your testimony, do the best you can to give me your impressions
as of that time, as free as it is possible for you to do of influence upon
that recollection by the course of events that took place on the 22d of November,
and what you read about this and thereafter, because it's important to us
to get as objective a report from you as we possibly can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I realize that. And this is why I say I'm not sure that it's really
true or something that you want to remember. It seems to me there was an
incident that he had a fight in the barracks at that particular time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. You men were quartered together in the same
barracks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's correct, in the same wing of this particular barracks.
They separated the Marines from the Air Force as much as possible, although
we did have Air Force personnel in the room with us, two in the room.</p>

<p>It seems to me at this particular time there was some kind of a squabble
and I can't recall what it was over, and this was the first time that he actually
showed, say, some backbone or willpower that he stood up to somebody, or
what the incident was over, I can't recall, but there is something that sticks
in the back of my mind there that something came up at this particular time.</p>

<p>He was a good student, as I recall. I can't say that he was any better than
anybody else. But again, as an individual he appeared to be just as good as
anybody wanted to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Our records show that he finished this course seventh in a
class of 30. Is that score somewhat of his ability?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I couldn't truthfully say; at that time I wasn't qualified to
say who <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you boys advised as to how each of you fared in the course
of your studies?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I can't truthfully say that either. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Reporter, I did interrupt the witness when he was talking
about his impression about Oswald. Would you read that back to me, please?</p>

<p>(Whereupon, the record was read by the reporter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had he had this nickname, Ozzie Rabbit, did he acquire that
before or&mdash;had he already acquired it when you boys came from Jacksonville
to Biloxi, or did you give it to him when you arrived at Keesler?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I think it was attached to him at Keesler as any individual
in our particular group were concerned; this was the first contact that most
of us had with each other as individuals. We were brought together here at
Keesler, and, of course, living and going to school together and in close proximity
with each other, we did get to know each other personally more than at
any other time.</p>

<p>I think this is the period of time that it was attached to my own mind as
well as the other people in the group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it you felt he was not aggressive as far as leadership
was concerned, and you boys felt that you didn't have to worry about him as
competitively?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I would say so, yes; but of course, at this time of our careers,
if you would like to call it that, of marines, there wasn't any real significance
attached to leadership. It was still&mdash;we were all the same rank. Of course,
one being in the service longer, there was always a senior marine as far as
I was concerned, and I was the marine in charge of this particular class if you&mdash;I
think this is the way they call it, class or flight squadron, whatever they
call it, and well, while at Keesler, I was promoted to corporal, which again
was an advancement in leadership, and, of course, there could never be any
differentiation of privates.</p>

<p>I was a corporal over privates, first class, and still with the closest relationship
that we had there, I don't think there was any rank barrier or difference
here.</p>

<p>I think we were all regarded that we were just marines at this school and
not trying to enforce authority at any particular time in which we would get
more in the infantry of the Marines. There a corporal is a corporal, but in
going to school like this, you wouldn't enforce discipline to a point where
people jumped when a person of higher rank said something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your rank when you were mustered out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Out of the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I was a sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What gave you the impression that he had or might have had
homosexual tendencies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Again, this is an unqualified opinion, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say "unqualified"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, because obviously, I'm not qualified to say one is or is not,
but having seen a number of them and seeing their characteristics, as far
as manner of walk, dress, and just their personality, I would say possibly his
was similar to them in some respects.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You found him a <span class="locked">feminine&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I would say yes; a lot of his mannerisms were closely related
to other homosexuals that I had seen in my life up to that period of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You said, in the course of your general statement, that your
group had the impression that he might be easily led. Can you elaborate on
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Well, let's not say the group felt that he was easy to lead. I
felt&mdash;let's say that I felt he was easily led, and the group felt that it was kind
of a group response that you would get here if what was good for the group
was good for everyone, and he would go along with what the group went along
with, and he wouldn't go out on the limb as one individual; at least at this
particular period of time he did not.</p>

<p>And I would say he was a group response&mdash;he was easily led; he was responsive
to the group as a whole.</p>

<p>At the same time I felt that he was an individual such as I see today. I see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
individuals that they are fascinated by education, and of course, not knowing
what his IQ was, and what his capacity for education was&mdash;still at the time
he impressed me as an individual who was quite intelligent and he would read
quite a lot, and so I would say he, by "being led," it would be more of a personal
opinion of my own that he was an individual that you could sway.</p>

<p>Now, these are opinions that I have of him after being educated further
myself, and seeing people every day, and in the teaching situation that I'm in,
that is somewhat similar to a mass hysteria, and I think he is the one that
you could brainwash or maybe that's the wrong term.</p>

<p>I think he is the individual that you would brainwash, and quite easy, and
this is the opinion of the personality and mind that he did have.</p>

<p>I think once he believed in something, by gosh he believed in it, and he stood
in his beliefs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how long have you been teaching?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. This will be my third year of teaching now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the extent of your formal education beyond high school,
if any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. The extent of my formal education beyond high school was a
Bachelor of Science Degree and presently working on a Master's Degree from
the University, and this will either be in physical education or guidance; I'm
not sure which way I'll go yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have your University of Minnesota education attendance
after you left the Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I had 1 year at the university before going to the Marine Corps,
and then I went after my service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you aware when you were in the service, or this period
about which we are speaking, that he had not graduated from high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Let's say I wasn't consciously aware of it. I was aware of
the fact that I was one of the few boys or the individuals there that had a
college education, and consequently also I had, after being in the Marines a
short period of time, I had a firm belief in finishing my education.</p>

<p>And I think this here put&mdash;or any individual, not only myself, or any individual
that had a college education, there was a number of them while I was in
the Marines at that particular time that did have a college education, we felt
intellectually we were somewhat above these boys in this particular group that
we ran in this particular time. And I think this was borne out by the fact
that we did more serious reading and we got into less crap games and went on
less liberties and things of this nature, and at this particular time, I only had
1 year of college education.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any feeling with respect to Oswald, any disappointment
on his part of his limited education at this stage of his life or any thing
resulting or desire on his part for further education?</p>

<p>Did you ever have any discussions with him on the subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. His opinions, is that what you're asking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I think that the reason he was in the Marine Corps was there
wasn't anything better for him to do at this time, was the reason that he felt,
and at least now, in recalling, again trying to recall, he felt this way about it.
And he was somewhat of a rolling stone; he didn't care to go to school. And
he'd just as soon go into the service to get out of the people's hair at home.
This type of attitude.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he get into any fights or arguments other than marines
jostling around as you would normally do, anything that attracted your attention
of any kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No; I would not say so. There isn't anything that stays in my
mind at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you return home and visit your folks during <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Leave before you had to return? You had to be at El Toro?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I gathered that you had the impression that he&mdash;during this
period of time that, this leave period&mdash;that he visited New Orleans?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Now that you brought New Orleans up, he used to&mdash;he used
to go home to New Orleans from Biloxi there, as I recall again. This was only
a short distance, between 50 and 71 miles, and he would go home on weekend
passes; and once we were through classes on Friday, we were free as long as
we were in class again on Monday morning, as I recall. And it seems to me
that he mentioned, or he did go home, that he wasn't in Mississippi or the
Biloxi area on weekends.</p>

<p>I might be wrong in this, but it seems to me that he did go all weekend, and
I think that you did mention New Orleans, that this possibly sticks in my
mind as associated with New Orleans and him at Biloxi, Miss.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you boys had liberty, did you tend to stick together on
your liberties or on occasion take your liberties together, one or more of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. As I recall now, as soon as school was over every day, we had
our liberty cards, we could leave, and then we could come back as long as we
were back on base in the morning to attend classes, and at this particular
period of time, I was married and my interests were somewhat different than
the other fellows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was your wife on the base?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No; she was not. She was living with my parents back home
in Minnesota, Owatonna. And my liberty usually consisted of going to the
beach and lying around suntanning or fooling or swimming, and lots of times
maybe three or four of us would go down&mdash;in my mind, we used to eat all the
spaghetti that we could get down there, and we would go downtown once in a
while; but as far as particularly going together, I would possibly say that the
boys from the east coast, Bandoni and Brereton, they were quite close, and
Camarata, that particular group, they were quite close, and&mdash;but if we were
just going down to lie around the beach, we would usually go over, and I
don't recall Oswald going with us, and I don't recall in my mind that he was
on liberty. And this would possibly bear out the fact that it's in my mind that
he went to New Orleans on weekends because it seems that he wasn't ever
around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But even at night when you were excused from class, did he
have a tendency to join the group or not join the group on your leave card
periods?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Well, there were so many things. Normally, as I recall, it
wasn't a general practice that we left the base during the week. Now, we
usually stayed around the barracks and either studied or go over to the gym
and work out or something of this nature, and I can't recall him in the barracks
except when we would have inspection on Saturdays or something in the Air
Force doing the inspection, and all the marines were complaining that we
shouldn't have to stay for an Air Force inspection, and again this substantiates
the idea that he went home to New Orleans because I think it came once a
month or something, and we happened to get in the period that we had two
of them, and he was anxious to go because inspection was Saturday morning,
and he wanted to get out early out of the base to leave, and he had to stand
inspection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this a fair statement, Mr. Powers, whether or not he went
to New Orleans on his weekend leave, he did not remain in the Biloxi area,
is your impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I couldn't say truthfully because I don't know what you mean
by the "Biloxi area." At least he did not remain on the Air Force base. He
left the Air Force base. Now, if he remained in Biloxi proper, the town, the
community, I'm not sure.</p>

<p>But it was my opinion that he was not in the close proximity. He would
be traveling over a period of time, then he would return to the base.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Our records show that at the time he left Keesler to travel to
El Toro, he was rated 4.2 in conduct and 4.5 in proficiency. What is that?
What do those grades mean in terms of the maximum or the minimum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I'm not sure what the scale&mdash;I cannot recollect what the scale
is. I think it was 5.0 is the top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You're right. And would 4.2 in conduct and 4.5 in proficiency
be a pretty fair rating?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Well, going back to what you said, he graduated seventh out of
30, it would be 4.5, which would be pretty good in the upper third of his class,
so to speak. 4.2 couldn't be too far behind. So I would imagine on a five
scale, 3.0 would be average. So 4.2 would be B plus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did that compare with yours, by the way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I don't know what mine was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No; I don't have any idea what my proficiency report was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. I take it that none of you boys traveled together to El
Toro, you went by your own respective routes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Camarata and myself, seems to me we flew into Chicago together,
and from there on, he went to Cedar Rapids, Iowa. And I continued
on to Minneapolis in the plane there; there was another marine that went with
us from, I think now, from Mississippi&mdash;from Biloxi into New Orleans. We
went on the bus together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it one of your group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; I think so. It was one of our group that was leaving.
And I want to say, it was <span class="locked">Bandoni&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's your best recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. But once into New Orleans, it seems that Camarata and I&mdash;this
is going through my mind of the limousine and on to the airport, and we continued
on. Maybe there was three of us, I'm not sure. But it seems to me there
was two of us, and I think we were at a movie theater, as my mind goes on.
And we did run into some of the other fellows there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But not Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I can't say truthfully if we ran into him or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And El Toro is the Marine <span class="locked">station&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your reporting date at El Toro?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. My reporting date at El Toro was 2400, 12 July 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any recollection of what Oswald did during the
intervening period, that is, this leave period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No; I do not. Except possibly there was something that was
stuck in my mind: we were on the ship going overseas, he mentioned Texas
and his mother. That's all that I can recollect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that he might have visited his mother in Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. It stays in my mind of Texas and his mother. Whether this is
truly true or not, it sticks there. And what the relationship was, I don't know,
or if he did visit her or when, I'm not sure. I think I was under the opinion
that he was from Texas. He used to say&mdash;I want to say Dallas, but I'm not
sure again if that is <span class="locked">planted&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; maybe it was Fort Worth, but it was some place in Texas,
but I can't say for sure with everything going; again I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything during these periods or thereafter of having
been a boy in New Orleans up to his high school period, having lived for a while
in Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Now, Texas and New Orleans are not associated in my mind.
New Orleans, this is where he used to go on weekends; this is where he used
to go quite a bit when he was in Mississippi. But as far as, let's say, hometown,
or home State, it was in my mind; it stuck it was Texas, but there was no
relationship between both of them other than this is where he went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did you remain at El Toro?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. We arrived the 12th of July in El Toro, Calif. This is when
I reported in. Now, when I actually went overseas, it was in the August draft,
I don't&mdash;to be truthful, I can't say when I went overseas. It was sometime in
August, around the first of August.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could it have been the middle of August, August 15th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. It's possible. I cannot say for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I have no record of when I did actually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Assuming that was the date, you were at El Toro
approximately a month then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's correct; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was your classification there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. How do you mean "classification"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, our records show that Oswald was classified as a replacement
trainee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's probably what I was, too, a replacement trainee for
overseas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was Oswald's response or attitude toward higher authority?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Up to this particular period of time, I don't think he showed
any attitude or response to higher authority other than he was like the rest
of the trainees, if you want to call it that; he did what he was told and that
was it.</p>

<p>I think his aggressive attitude came after he was away from his initial
exposure to the Marine Corps-type discipline.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you with him during that period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I was with him overseas. Well, he was actually in the same
unit as I was until I came home, and this is where I noticed that he had started
to be more aggressive, and outgoing in his manner. In other words, he took
on a new personality, and now he was Oswald the man rather than Oswald
the rabbit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was after you boys got overseas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; I think so. I think&mdash;this is when I noticed&mdash;it can be
safe to say that he did start to have more incidents of where he would stand
for his own rights if there were rights to be had. In other words, he was going
to take everything that came, and he wasn't going to let anybody else get what
he could have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember anything in the particular incident that you
think might be helpful to the Commission during that 1-month period of time
that you were at El Toro?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. At this particular time, I have no memory of the individual at
all. It seems to me that he reported in after I did, I think, and this is where
again something is in my mind of Texas. He said he was in Texas for this
period of time, and him coming&mdash;being there first&mdash;the most we got into&mdash;I
think we got into an August draft, and I don't think he was in the same draft
that I was in. I think I reported in and got in the July draft.</p>

<p>Now, again, I'm not sure on this, but it seems to me that he was in a different
draft than I was, and we were all in the same barracks to start, and then they
separate you in these replacements drafts, and again it's in my mind when he
reported in or possibly he came in late off his leave, he took an extra week or
something.</p>

<p>It might be in my mind, I can't say for sure, but it still remains there, that
he was in Texas or Texas was the area he was visiting or he took his leave in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, then, you were&mdash;you boys were shipped out from El Toro?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For overseas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he on the same ship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Well, he must have been in the same draft; he was on the same
ship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From what port did you sail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. In my&mdash;we left from San Diego.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember the name of the ship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No; I don't remember the name of the ship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would it refresh your recollection if I uttered the name Bexar,
B-e-x-a-r; would that mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I think possibly, yes; I think it was on the Peter boats and
Mike boats.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is a Mike boat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. These are the terms given to these landing crafts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That were on the ship itself?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; they're running over the ship; they're used for loading
and unloading of supplies and running back and forth while we're on the
harbor, taking people off leave and from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, your embarkation was&mdash;would you check your orders, the
21st of August, am I correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I'm not sure. From here I don't have any orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I think these orders are all in the group orders, and they are
not given to individuals as such.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. All right. You went from San Diego to what port, what
foreign port?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yokohama. Again, I'm not sure. I think it was Yokohama.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yokosuka rather than Yokohama?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; there is two of them right in the same proximity. Yokosuka
is probably the right one. I'm not sure now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the military base?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That we reported to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Atsugi.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A-t-s-u-g-i?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is the Marine base?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Navy base with Marine squadrons flying out of it, but it's primary
mission is a Navy base.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, were these same boys, Bandoni, Brereton, Camarata, yourself,
Schrand, and Oswald, were you still a group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I don't think Bandoni was part of the group; no. He must have
been because I have pictures. I don't think that <span class="locked">he&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, do you have pictures of&mdash;any pictures of these taken
during the course of your time in the Marines which Oswald appears in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Just the one picture that I have of him appearing is a class-type
photo when we got out of Keesler Air Force Base, and it shows Marine and Air
Force personnel that graduated.</p>

<p>I have never run across any pictures of him of barracks life or anything like
that.</p>

<p>Going back to your original question: Brereton was on it, and Camarata and
Schrand&mdash;maybe Schrand came later, I can't say for sure. But Oswald and
myself, but I think that Bandoni went on the east coast, but Brereton went to
Iwakuni, which is another Air Force&mdash;rather Marine base, and Camarata went
down to a helicopter base somewhere in Japan, down in the harbor somewhere.
I used to call him on the phone once in a while and talk to him.</p>

<p>And Brereton, I think&mdash;no, by gosh, maybe Bandoni was down at&mdash;no, that
was Mike Cainey. We were flying between the Philippines, and if he would stop
in at Iwakuni, I would stop in and see Mike.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Iwakun, this is a base in the lower part of Japan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">I-O-W-C&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I-o-w-a-k-o-n-n-i, I think. Iwakuni&mdash;i-e-, possibly. I think it's -i.
I don't know. I'm lost, where I was. It seems to me that Brereton was over
there, too, at Iwakuni, but I don't recall if I possibly saw him over there once or
twice; it was either on a football trip or when I was flying down to the Philippines
after wrestling season.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, tell us about the trip over to Yokosuka, the life on the boat
and what he did and what you did and what things you did together, if anything,
conversations that you had, those that you overheard, your opinion of him during
that period, and reaction of the platoon or group to Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. At this particular period of time, now, you're starting to get into,
say, the rank association that people of higher rank associate with people of
lower rank at this particular period of time, you do see it more coming in the
group relationship and this was brought about by my becoming a corporal, and I
wasn't assigned some of the tasks that the privates, first class, and privates were
assigned, and I recall I didn't have to do anything going over, and there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
some duties assigned naturally, and with him as an individual, I can remember
that he taught me how to play chess going over, and he was quite a proficient
chess player, and, well, let's not say he was not real proficient; he used to beat
me, and it wouldn't take too much proficiency to beat me. And he would sit and
play, and we would maybe play&mdash;usually we played 1 game a day, and sometimes
we would play 4 to 8 hours, playing chess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Four?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Four to eight hours playing chess. And I got to a point where
I beat him once in a while, and it would irritate him a little bit that someone
beat him, but not to a point where he would get violent or anything of this nature,
but he was real happy and pleased when he would win.</p>

<p>And again looking back at this, it gives me some impressions about him. He
was real happy to win, like he was accomplishing something in his life.</p>

<p>And he used to read quite a bit. I remember we got these paperbacks, and
there was some good literature in these, and he would swap books back and forth,
and he would never be reading any of the shoot-em-up westerns or anything like
that. Normally, it would be a good type of literature; and the one that I recall
was "Leaves of Grass," by Walt Whitman. And he had it for a period of time,
and I would want to read it for myself, and as it came about, he did let me have
it. I think I still have the book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall the titles of any other books that he read?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Oh, I'm not saying that he read them, but the reason that I recall
these titles is because I still have most of these paperbacks that I kept quite a
few of these, and they were the "Age of Reason," and "Age of Enlightenment,"
and whether he read these or not, I'm not sure. But I think there is something on
the "Greatest President of the United States," and democracy, and books of that
nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did you obtain these books?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. They were given to the troops&mdash;I'll use that for a lack of a
better term&mdash;periodically throughout the voyage going over, where they got
them, I don't know. I think they probably just picked them up and it was
standard procedure, I assume.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were books that were distributed through the Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you could read them or not as you saw fit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your recollection is that you do recall Oswald did read
"Leaves of Grass"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Right. Whether he read the other books, I'm not sure, but this
leads me to the impression that he was trying to read something that was deeper
than the average paperback that you see in the drug store or something of that
nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These were books which you were interested in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; these were books which I was interested in mainly because
the image that I held at that time that I was more educated than the other individuals
and in order to maintain this image, and for my own personal satisfaction
as well, I read these books, and I think this is&mdash;whether he read these
books for his own personal satisfaction or to create an image similar to the
ones that we had&mdash;I say "we," the people that had more education than the
average marine there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he a voracious reader?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. What do you mean by the word "voracious"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he read a great deal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I can't truthfully say. I think everyone at that particular time
read more than they possibly did at any other period that they had in the
Marine Corps. Mainly, you are in a limited space and this was the thing to do;
it was easy to do, and you could entertain yourself this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. I take it it was not your impression, then, at least at this
stage of the game, he devoted a great deal of his time to reading as distinguished
from what other Marines were doing in that regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Well, I don't know. It seems to me when we were in Mississippi
that he did read some&mdash;he was doing further reading than other&mdash;what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
normal individual was doing at that time. I can't recall what would substantiate
that in my mind; it just stuck in my mind that he did some reading, or all
during this period of time that he was an individual that, rather than play poker
or go out on liberty, he was just as well content to stay and read a book or
things of this nature, and this may be that he was outside of the group and he
did this <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mentioned poker, so I assume that you played poker on the
trip over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I don't play. I don't play cards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, were there poker games, however, on the way over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I imagine there was. There was card games to some nature,
whether it was poker or something, I don't know. To be truthful, I don't
recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Oswald engage in the card games whenever there <span class="locked">were&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I don't know; I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall whether he did any gambling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I don't recall; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anything else that you recall occurred on this ship, either something
that occurred or impressions that you have or now have of this man during
this period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the purpose of perhaps refreshing your recollection, was
there an occasion in which he made some comment that "All the Marine Corps
did was to teach you to kill," and after you got out of the Marines, you might
be good gangsters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; he made that statement. Now, whether it was at this particular
period of time or not, I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do recall that he made that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That statement was made and I think it was&mdash;he was probably
parroting somebody else that made the statement previously. And I think
it was&mdash;this was a common statement, but as I recall, he&mdash;he did say this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. But now when we were playing chess at one period of time,
whether it was on the ship or not, I'm not sure, possibly it could have been in
Japan, but it would most likely have been on that ship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, however, that this you might classify as some <span class="locked">griping&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Over the Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. This would be normal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or something similar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. You wouldn't attach any significance to it. Someone would say,
"The Marine Corps stinks," or something of this type, and whether one individual
said it or another, you wouldn't attach any significance to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Atsugi is about 35 miles from Tokyo, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you reached Atsugi, what was your assignment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. We were assigned to Marine Air Control Squadron No. 1, and
assigned to crews within this squadron.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have some abbreviation for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. MACS 1, M-A-C-S 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were headquartered at the naval air station at Atsugi,
Japan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oswald&mdash;what did he serve as? I mean, was he a radar operator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I assume he was a radar operator. From here I lost almost
total contact with the individual other than just seeing him. I played football
during the fall and during this period of time we would play, we played in
the bowl games, and the squadron went down to the Philippines, and I stayed
in Japan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't go to the Philippines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I did at a later date, but when the rest of the squadron went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
down to the Philippines, they went down, oh, I don't know, probably sometime
in November, and I stayed down and played football, and then after that, I was
wrestling&mdash;I wrestled for a while, and then out of the blue came orders to go
to the Philippines, and from that time, I think this was sometime in the middle
of <span class="locked">January&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the function of MACS 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. It was a squadron composed of a radar group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About how many men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Oh, in estimating, I would say 100 personnel at the most, and its
function was to support landings with the control of aircraft to particular target
areas or target sites, and you would control the aircraft by radar rather than
trying to use it all by visual flight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say "control aircraft," what do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. You would not actually control the aircraft by flying it yourself,
the operator or pilot would have to control the aircraft, and you would direct
him as far as his turn is concerned, and his degrees, and turn 90° right, and
you would control him to an intercept, so to speak, to another aircraft and you
would intercept it until he got in range or where he could see it visually, and
they took over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you would be communicating with him in some fashion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; you would have him on radio, and at the same time, when
we were in Atsugi, we were assigned, it seems to me, a particular sector of the
horizon to cover to protect against incoming foreign aircraft, and you plotted
it all on the board. You called it a "bogey" coming in, and they would scramble
aircraft and intercept this bogey, if it didn't have the identification system on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And were these simulated <span class="locked">enemy&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; I would say in our operations that they were in the Philippines,
as I recall, it was all simulated. When we were in Japan, however, you
would get the actual thing where you would have the scramble aircraft on a hot
bogey&mdash;I think is the term that they used&mdash;and maybe it would be a Russian
aircraft or Chinese aircraft straying into this particular area, and they would
scramble aircraft after it and go up and take a look-see. And that is as far as I
knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And so while you were in Japan, you would be actually looking
for hot bogeys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; I actually never spent that much time on the site. I was
playing football <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. So as I recall, that is what we used to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Oswald play football?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No; he was not athletic in any form.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He didn't engage in any athletics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Not while I was in contact with him; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mentioned when you boys were in Keesler you sometimes
went to the gym. Did he go to the gym and work out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I can't recall that he ever did; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You eventually rejoined the squadron or the group, did you, in
the Philippines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Oh, it was in the middle of January or February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of 1958?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Of 1958; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where in the Philippines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Cubi Point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. C-u-b-i?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; Cubi Point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was the nature of that installation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. This was just temporary quarters for the squadron. They were
caught in between. They were at an operation early in November and then
this&mdash;something&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be November of 1957?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes. Something flared up, I believe, in Indonesia, somewhere
in that area, and they held the squadron on the ship for a particular period of
time; and then there was another operation going to start in February or
sometime, or March, and they <span class="locked">just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of 1958?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, sir; instead of sending them back up to Japan, and then
have to come all the way back again, they just put them ashore at Cubi Point.
And they just set up a temporary base and continued the operation out of
there. There was actually no radar site setup at that area, and we just got
the gear and other material and trucks and apparatus and things, and equipment
was repaired and made ready for the next operation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And during your stay at the Philippines, were you ever at
Subic Bay instead of Cubi Point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Cubi Point and Subic Bay are at close proximity. Cubi Point
is the landing actually, and Subic Bay is the harbor, and you can almost call
it one actual installation as far as I was concerned, but they were designated&mdash;Cubi
Point was the landing strip and Subic Bay was the landing area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In some of Oswald's autobiographical material prepared either
then or later, he refers to the fact that it was at Subic Bay, and that doesn't
appear in the official orders, and we wondered where he got that, and now you
explained it for us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. You traveled in between both, as far as they had the swimming
point there; I remember it was at Subic&mdash;isn't it S-u-b-i-c?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't want to say it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I thought it was Subic; I'm probably wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I won't say that you're wrong. I think you're right. It's Cubi
Point and Subic Bay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; there was actually one installation in my mind. They
were separated, but one was the harbor for the ships and the other was for
the aircraft.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, was the same group that we&mdash;that you described earlier
that came from Jacksonville, Fla., still together at Cubi Point when you rejoined
the squadron?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. All but certain elements. I think the people in my particular
group that originated in Jacksonville, the only people that were left was
Schrand, Oswald, and myself. And the rest of them were dispersed in Japan
or the Far East area or in the United States somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did an incident occur with respect to Mr. Schrand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; he was&mdash;this happened after I arrived from the Japanese
mainland. He was on guard duty one evening and he was shot to death. Now,
I have never seen the official report or anything, but the scuttlebutt at that time
was that he was shot underneath the right arm and it came up from underneath
the left neck, and it was by a shotgun which we were authorized to carry while
we were on guard duty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were these also sometimes called riot guns?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Riot guns; yes. And that is the only thing that&mdash;significance
I attach to it other than he was either leaning against the shotgun or was fooling
with it, but he was shot anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there&mdash;you don't know what the official finding was with
respect <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No; I do not. I never had access to anything of this nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any scuttlebutt about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No; other than that he was fooling with the weapon. Other
than that, we couldn't&mdash;as I recall, we could never realize how a guy could
have shot himself there other than he was leaning on it this way [indicating],
and "boom," it went off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As far as you boys were concerned at that time, was there any
scuttlebutt or speculation about anyone of you being involved in that incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Not to my recollection at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When I say "you," that includes Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Not that I know of; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Weren't there some instructions in connection with the use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
of those riot guns when you were on guard duty that you would keep the
chamber free of slugs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I'm almost sure&mdash;again I can't say for sure, but it seems to
me that we were issued three shells, and&mdash;again, I'm not sure; it seems to me
that we were not supposed to put them in the weapon or supposed to put them
in the weapon and keep it out of the chamber; in other words, you jacked it
into the chamber if you needed it, but your chamber itself should be kept free.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To avoid accidents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; I think this was the rule because you would have to click
them to get them out this way, and to avoid an incident such as happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you boys do any maintenance work in connection with your
radar scanning assignment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. We were not trained to do it; no. They had the assigned personnel
do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall anything in this connection with respect to guard
duty relating to some kind of a special airplane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, we&mdash;this happened again, I think, after the rest of the
squadron left to go back to the Japanese mainland, and some of us were assigned
temporary duty in Cubi Point there. I believe there were two of us, or
three of us from the squadron.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Murphy; I believe, was one of them; and Private&mdash;Private,
First Class Murphy, and I don't recall the other individuals, who the other
individuals were, but anyway, we were assigned there, and at this particular
time, they were closely guarding a hangar. And as it developed, this was, not
knowing then what it was, it was a U-2 aircraft, but this was after the rest of
the squadron left, which Oswald was included in, for the mainland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oswald was included in a group that had returned to the
mainland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Oswald still at Cubi Point when Marine Schrand was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I believe he was; yes. The whole squadron was there then, so
he must have been there; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But Schrand's guard duty was not guard duty in connection with
these special airplanes of which you now speak?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Well, no; I don't believe so. I can't say that for sure, what it
was regarding. But I don't think so. I think they were on the site guarding
the equipment that he had there, and it seems to me that the Air Force moved
in that particular hangar after the squadron went up. I think this is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there a&mdash;did you have an assignment when you were
shipped to Corregidor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; this assignment came between when I originally flew in to
Cubi Point and then the squadron went on another operation where they were
preparing&mdash;after they prepared their equipment there, and we went down to
Corregidor and we stayed there approximately a month or 6 weeks at the most,
and then we came back and then the people, they dropped off the four or five
personnel that were on temporary duty, and then the rest of the squadron continued
on to the mainland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Oswald part of the group that was assigned to Corregidor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; the whole squadron was assigned to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what did you do at Corregidor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. We participated in a&mdash;I think it was the 3d Marine Division
in the operation of military exercises.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The same sort of thing that you had been doing back in Cubi
Point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; with the exception now that we were plotting simulated
aircraft, scanning for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any incident occur during that period involving Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No; nothing that I recall. Something sticks in my mind about
being on mess duty, but I can't recall what the incident was. I have a picture
of it in my mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did mention to the FBI when you were interviewed that he
was on mess duty, and I assume in the first place he was not on mess duty all the
time while he was in the Philippines, was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No; you're assigned&mdash;privates and privates first class are assigned
this duty periodically. I think you're assigned one week out of the year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was not a mess duty assignment by way of punishment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long were you at Corregidor, a couple of months?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I want to say 4 to 6 weeks, but it could have been longer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your means of transportation to and from Corregidor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. LST.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's landing ship tank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when was this? Along about March of 1958, is that your
recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I think it was; it was in this late-February-early-March period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you returned to Cubi Point, you stayed there, but Oswald
and some of the other members of the squadron returned to Japan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; I think they left out four, four of us stayed behind at Cubi
Point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you do&mdash;did you return then to Atsugi?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I think it was in May.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of 1958?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, sir; late April or early May of 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you reached Atsugi, was Oswald there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. During this period of time, I think he was there, but it was
shortly thereafter or just before I got there he was&mdash;he shot himself in the
hand or in the leg or something. I don't remember which part of the body it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the left arm or elbow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I'm not sure. I couldn't truthfully say what it was. He was
in a different part of the barracks and I think it was in the evening that they
hauled him out in an ambulance; yes, it must have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your information and what is still your information
with respect to that incident? How it occurred, and whatnot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. He was fooling with a weapon, whether he was cleaning it or
what he was doing with it; I don't know. You see, this is what I recall: He
was cleaning the weapon and it accidentally discharged, and he was hauled
away, and I think he was charged with carrying a concealed weapon or something
of this nature; I'm not sure.</p>

<p>They brought him up for court-martial. Whether he was actually court-martialed
then, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was a privately owned weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I think so. All the less, it wasn't&mdash;I don't think it was a Government
issue; I think it was a small caliber. I think it was a .22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; .22 pistol.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the scuttlebutt about that particular incident, if any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Nothing. It&mdash;just the name again stuck to&mdash;"Ozzie screwed
up again," or something. That was probably the general statement. I think
this was the feeling of the group at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you used an expression "screwed up again." I'm going
to ask you now what was the reputation of Oswald and the attitude of the
squadron with respect to <span class="locked">him&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Well, going back <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During this period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I think this idea of him being a somewhat weaker individual
held&mdash;well, he was in the squadron here&mdash;physically he was not an overpowering
individual, and "Ozzie," I think, stuck with him most of the time through
the time he was in the Marines or at least the period that I was associated with
him, and he did what he was told and never went out of the way to do any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
more, or just doing the least minimum that he could do as far as any type of
work or anything like that, and he would screw up once in a while; and now
in the terms of the Marine Corps, it would mean that he wouldn't always present
himself in a first-class manner as far as dress or shave or sloppy in appearance
sometimes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how was he getting along with his fellow Marines during
this period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I think they accepted him just as they did everyone else, because
again you have a mixture of personalities, and I don't recall that he was
friendly with any one particular person more than the other. Again I'm not
sure because he was in this particular <span class="locked">crew&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any scuttlebutt or rumor that he shot himself to get out
of the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I don't know. There might have been. Now, that you recall&mdash;you
say that, you recall it to my mind; I'm not sure whether I want to recall
it or something that is actually fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I couldn't say truthfully.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But any matter, it was pure scuttlebutt; it was pure speculation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, because nobody actually knew what was going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the scuttlebutt as to his court-martial; was that because
he had the unregistered or private weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Now that you say that, this court-martial, this is maybe where
they came in and they were going to try to give him a court-martial for shooting
himself to get out. Again, maybe this is something again that I want to recall
or if it's actually true; now that you mentioned it, there is something of that
nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you use the expression "something that you want to recall,"
what you mean by that, I take it, is you want to avoid the tendency to recall
something <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I have heard somewhere else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. More than a speculation or hearsay, and you're telling me that
you're trying to confine yourself to actual fact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you're making that distinction for that reason?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any rumor or scuttlebutt that he at one time had been
given some psychiatric attention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Now that you mentioned it, he might have been put in the&mdash;he
might have been sent to the psychiatric ward in Yokohama; I'm not&mdash;again now
that you mentioned it, again it comes in my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any&mdash;is this in the area of guessing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. It's scuttlebutt-type of thing. It's guessing and no way to substantiate
it or anything of this nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Okay. What did Oswald do for entertainment on leaves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. This seems to me now that he made a statement, and this was
after he went out and procured or secured a female companionship and set up
housekeeping or whatever you want to call it in Japan, and this was common
practice&mdash;and it seems to me at one time he made a statement that he didn't care
if he returned to the United States at all. Now, I'm almost&mdash;well, I can't say
for sure, but I attribute this statement to him again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he set up housekeeping, set up some Japanese girl; is that
what you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes. This is&mdash;this was the normal procedure over there, the
practice with a lot of individuals, and I think that he was one of the ones that
did&mdash;went for this type of thing. I'm not sure whether he did, but I can attribute
this statement to him that he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, you have a recollection of him having said that
somewhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; he said that, and again looking back, he was finally attaining
a male status or image in his own eyes, and this is why he wanted to
stay in that particular country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But he did say something to the effect that he'd just as soon
stay in Japan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Rather than return to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you given liberty when you were at Atsugi the way you
were given liberty at Biloxi, that is, at certain hours of the day or on weekends,
you would have liberty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Gee, you have to secure liberty cards to get off the base at
Atsugi, and by doing this, some weekends you had a duty weekend, and&mdash;but
you have to be all squared away as far as your duty weekend, and have no
disciplinary action or anything of this nature against you before you got your
liberty card, and then you checked out to the sergeant on duty and went on
liberty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how often were you permitted this liberty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. As I recall, you could get it on every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what about weekends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. And, say, weekends, and possibly once a month you had duty
weekend, so 3 weekends out of the month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you would have 3 out of the 4?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Per month?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Possibly every fifth one we stood, but I think it was 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, three out of four you had liberty, and 1 of the
weekends, the fourth one you stood on duty at camp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Oswald tend to take all the liberty that he could get?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I couldn't truthfully say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. What was that operation called in the Philippines,
Operation Strong Back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I believe the second one was Strong Back, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say "second one," what do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. The first one they went down to&mdash;when I stayed down to play
football; I don't remember what that was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But the one that you attended was Operation Strong Back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I think so; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you boys ever sent to Formosa?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, we&mdash;this was on our way home. Now, this wasn't&mdash;he was
still in Japan, as I remember; he must have&mdash;yes, he was still in Japan, and
on our way home, we went to Formosa and no one got off the ship; we just
picked up some civilians, I believe, there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But Oswald was not there with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No. And then we just went on <span class="locked">across&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. While you continued to have acquaintance and contact with
Oswald, did his rank change from private to private first class?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall Oswald having received discipline as a result of the
court-martial involving the discharge of the .22 caliber pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I think this came after, if it did come, it probably came after
I left Japan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I arrived home on the 4th of July, so I must have been en route
most of June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you don't recall any punishment that was meted out to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I don't know; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, discussion was had off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Back on the record. Now, in connection with your remarks that
he stated to you that he'd just as soon stay in Japan, do you recall, was there
any scuttlebutt in the squadron that he applied for an extension of his stay in
Japan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I don't know. I can't say that I recall anything because a lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
people did make this kind of statement, and you never again attached any
significance to it.</p>

<p>Some individuals did extend&mdash;rather ask for an extension. Whether he did
or not, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about Oswald's drinking habits or propensities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I think that he probably maybe experienced inebriation maybe
possibly for his first time while he was in Japan, extensively at least; and
other than that, I don't know. And a lot of the guys just went out, and that's
all they went out for, to get drunk, and that was it. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you have no impression of Oswald in that particular connection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No; nothing. My actual association with him in Japan was
limited to other than just seeing him in the barracks and saying, "Hi, Ozzie."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he have any interest in the Russian language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Somewhere along the line he was reading a Russian book or
something. I'm not sure, again, whether it was written in Russian or whether
it was written in the American language. It pertained to the Russian philosophy,
but there is something in my mind that I relate&mdash;associate, reading this
type of literature. I think it was in Japan, but I'm not sure, though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any impression of him studying the Russian language
as such?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. In actually sitting down and studying it; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In seeking to become familiar with the language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I would say no; no, that I do not because I just don't have any
real concrete recollections for the individual other than just brief glimpses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you still acquainted with him, still stationed with him
when there arose an incident where he had an altercation with a noncommissioned
officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I'm not sure. It seems to me I was, but again I'm not sure.
It either came&mdash;I truthfully can't say, but there is something again, maybe
something that I read since then, or since when all of this came out, something
that I read, but there is something in my mind that he had a fight with a noncommissioned
officer or something of this nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That wasn't extraordinary; that would occur once in a while?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes. All of a sudden a guy blows up and swings at somebody,
and right away it's a fight. And if it could be blown out of proportion, too, if
the noncommissioned officer wanted to take it, any time take a swing or strike
a blow, it was supposed to be a serious offense in the Marines; well, is it or not,
I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By this time, were you a sergeant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I believe I made sergeant right before I came home, or&mdash;I think
it was a week or two right before I came home. I was a sergeant before I left
to come home, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Still at this time Oswald continued to have the reputation that
he was not an aggressive person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No; I don't think&mdash;I think he came out of his shell, to coin a
phrase; he was becoming older and more mature, and he stood a little more for
his personal rights; at least, this is an opinion that you get from the incident
that he did have there in the barracks, not from close relationships with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have a recollection that in Japan he began to stand up
for his own rights?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was a little more aggressive than he was back in the States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes. Again this might go back to the area that he was too
scared the first year or so or 9 months while he was in the Marine Corps, after
coming out of the initial indoctrination of coming out of training, and then he
becomes himself, so you can't make a subjective appraisal during that first 9
months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever express any sympathy toward the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. None that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Toward Communist principles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. None that I recall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or Marxist doctrines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. None that I recall; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or did he ever discuss those subjects with you or in your
presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I'm not sure. He didn't discuss them to any great length or to
any issues that I would recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nothing to excite you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Nothing that I would attach any political significance to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was his attitude toward discipline in the Marine Corps?
Was it antagonistic? Was it different in any degree from other marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No; I don't think that it was. I think he was like any other
marine, that he made his bed and now he was going to have to lie in it. He
volunteered. A lot of complaining just as anyone else did. But nothing that
you could say that was any different than any other individual. However,
he, again going back to the incident that he did have, he was somewhat, if you
want to call it, hostile, so to speak, to authority. He must have been&mdash;or he
had something that would bother him that he would flare up once in a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He would?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Can you give me any <span class="locked">incident&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Well, just going <span class="locked">back&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would express that opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Well, in Japan or something, possibly in the barracks, I recall,
or like in Biloxi, he had some scuffles. I said he was coming out of his shell,
and showing more aggressiveness, but I wouldn't say that this guy is a trouble
maker. I would say that the opinion of him would be that you couldn't depend
on him in a situation, that you could give him the responsibility, but
then you couldn't really say that he would accept it, but you could be sure
with other individuals; you knew that they would accept it, but I don't think
that he did this only because he wasn't sure of himself. I think if you did
give him authority and he realized what the position of authority was that
he would accept it and he would probably pride himself in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But at least during this period of time, he hadn't reached the
stage of dependability that you men of higher rank would rely on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Well, I wasn't in a position to delegate authority to him, but
again, as I say, this is a personal opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did&mdash;in any conversation that you had with him, or any conversations
in your presence which he wasn't present in, was there anything
mentioned about his being in Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or Milwaukee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I cannot say; I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or did he ever mention somebody by the name of Ruby, Jack
Ruby or Rubenstein, Jack Rubenstein?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No, sir; not to the best of my knowledge. I never heard that
name associated with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Even when he was in Japan, did he tend to stay to himself by
and large?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I would say yes. I think that he did. Again I couldn't be
sure because he was in a different crew, and they would be on liberty at a
different time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you ever recall him being intoxicated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Not distinctly; no. It seems to me that here again it's just a
picture in my mind, that he would come in the barracks feeling good, and acting
silly; so whether you would associate intoxication with <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever get into any fights while you were over in Japan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Oh, he probably did; probably no more than any other individual
in close relationship with the people that you are there with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever talk about Gen. Robert E. Lee or any possible
relationship that he may have had in the distant past or association by name
<span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. It seems to me that there was&mdash;he was quite proud of Lee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Harvey Oswald. There was some relationship there in the Civil War type of
thing. I'm not sure what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During your period of association with him and knowledge of
him, did he have a reputation of being an odd-ball of any kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Well, I think the term is loosely taken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Odd-ball, which is attributed to his characteristics that he did
have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There might have been a lot of odd-balls in the Marines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. There are a lot of odd-balls in the Marines; let's say there are
a lot of odd-balls everywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But nothing occurred that would lead you to describe him as
an odd-ball?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Well, he was different. You could use it&mdash;what an odd-ball
means to you and what an odd-ball means to myself and to everyone, it's
different.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I'm trying to go along with you; he was different.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. He was a different individual, I would say, than the normal
personality that you would see in the Marine Corps because he was&mdash;which I
previously stated, I think&mdash;he was a quiet&mdash;if you want to call it&mdash;a reserved
individual that had feminine characteristics, that to me, he was shy, so to
speak, and a lot of times you felt sorry because the rest of the guys were most
of the time picking on him; this goes back to the Ozzie Rabbit incident.</p>

<p>And he was somewhat the frail, little puppy in the litter. At least, this
was the opinion I think they got from him, and maybe he fell right into this
image all along through the Marine Corps; maybe it just followed him. And
maybe&mdash;physically, like I say, he was not an impressive specimen, at that
time he wasn't, that the Marine Corps tries to portray is one of the big-type
individualists, and he didn't fall into that, and consequently he was an oddball
from the Marine Corps' own definition of what a Marine is supposed to&mdash;ideally
supposed to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he argumentatively inclined?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Somewhat. I wouldn't say he was&mdash;he just took the opposite side
of the argument, but I think that he was possibly more intelligent than most
of the individuals that were in the Marine Corps&mdash;well, I wouldn't say possibly;
I would say he appeared to be more intelligent than most of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you drawing the distinction between when you say "intelligence,"
education and the development of intelligence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Let's say his capacity, and he appeared to be better developed,
even not knowing what his educational background was at the time. At least,
his diction and his knowledge of different subjects appeared to be more advanced
than some of the other people in the group or in the groups that he was
in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you think there might have been any resentment on that
account?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. There may have been, I suppose, the frail&mdash;maybe he portrayed
that image&mdash;frail, know-it-all, studious type of person. And, of course, some
of the individuals&mdash;this is maybe why they were in the Marine Corps, to get
away from the type of individual or scholastic problems or school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any impression as to what kind of a marksman he
was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I don't know; he was not in my platoon. At least, I don't think
he was. I don't have any conscious recollection of him there, but all marines
train to shoot the rifle proficiently, and the pistol and the Browning automatic
rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any scuttlebutt that he was an officer hater?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he evidence, as far as you recall, any impatience with people
who appeared not to have the command of any particular subject that he had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I don't know; maybe not more so than anything else. He had
the patience to teach me chess, but then again, you would sit there and pondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
a move or something, and he, as I recall now, he would say "Come on; let's
get going." And he seemed to be an individual that was&mdash;wanted to keep things
moving at quite a rapid pace.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any impression that he had a tendency&mdash;maybe
I asked you this&mdash;to keep by himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. For himself to keep by himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To keep by himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I don't know. I don't think I can truthfully answer that <span class="locked">because&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't think you had enough contact with him in Japan
because he was not a member of your platoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In an FBI interview, did you express the opinion that he was
resentful of authority? Do you still hold that view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. He probably was not resentful to authority; he was resentful
of the position of authority that he could not command, not of the authority itself,
I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. It didn't make a difference who was administering&mdash;rather
what the authority was, it was probably the individual administering it probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember a marine by the name of Delgado?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I can't say that I do; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thornley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mentioned Murphy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was Murphy's first name, do you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Jim Murphy. I don't think that was it either; I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A marine by the name <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. We used to call him Murph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Murray?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Osborne?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Shoemaker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Botelho?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That may have been pronounced Botelho. Did he spend any
time listening to records, classical music, and that sort of thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Not that I recall; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever have any discussions with him or were there any
discussions in your presence at the same time that he was present about
religion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Botelho's full name was James Anthony Botelho; Call's full
name was Richard Dennis Call. You mentioned Camarata, Donald P. Camarata?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you remember a marine by the name of Peter Cassisi?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No, sir; I don't. If I saw the face, I could probably recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A fellow by the name of Peter Francis Connor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes; I recall that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember a commanding officer at Santa Ana by the
name of John E. Donovan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember a marine by the name of John Heindel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Sometimes called Hidell? This is Atsugi now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A marine by the name of Erwin Donald Lewis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think I asked about Murray, David Christie Murray. Murphy's
name was Paul, Paul Edward Murphy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You remember him in the Far East?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, he was in the same crew that I was in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Osborne's first name was Mac, M-a-c.</p>

<p>Well, that completes my examination. And any further reflections which
I will ask you to do as you sit there now, can you think of anything that you
think might be pertinent here to the Commission in its overall investigation,
calling on your experiences during the period that you had contact with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. No; I don't think there is really anything that I can add. I
think that the problem is that there are hundreds of kids running around like
him today that can be easily influenced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, in the taking of these depositions, and you find
in most regulations and rules that we adopted, you have the right to read your
deposition over and make any corrections in it if you wish, and to sign it. You
may waive that, if you wish also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. I waive it; there is no reason <span class="locked">why&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As far as you're <span class="locked">concerned&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. As far as I'm concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You rely on the accuracy of the reporter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="t289"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_JOHN_E_DONOVAN" id="TESTIMONY_OF_JOHN_E_DONOVAN">TESTIMONY OF JOHN E. DONOVAN</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of John E. Donovan was taken at 10:30 a.m., on May 5, 1964, at
200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C., by Mr. John Hart Ely, member
of the staff of the President's Commission. Richard M. Mosk, also a member of
the staff, was present.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would you stand, please?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Please be seated. My name is John Ely.</p>

<p>The gentleman directly to my right is Richard Mosk. We are both members of
the staff of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President
Kennedy, which was appointed by President Johnson to investigate all the facts
and circumstances surrounding the death of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>The rules of the Commission require that I give to you a copy of the Executive
Order No. 11130, which is the President's order creating this Commission, a
copy of the Joint Resolution of Congress, and a copy of the Commission's rules
which relate to the questioning of witnesses.</p>

<p>Is it correct to say that I have given you a copy of each of these documents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. You gave them to me, and I gave them a cursory reading.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would you state your full name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. John E. Donovan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. 2009 Belmont Road, NW., Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I teach school at Ascension Academy, Alexandria, Va.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And prior to teaching at Ascension Academy, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I attended medical school last year at Georgetown University.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You did not, however, get a medical degree?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Previous to attending medical school, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I attended the University of Dayton; Dayton, Ohio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. This is after you got out of the Marine Corps?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes. Eight months prior to that, I worked for a bank in
Boston, Mass. Prior to that, I was employed by the U.S. Marine Corps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. For how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Three years and 3 months, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And what was the rank at which you were discharged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. First lieutenant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You had had higher education before you entered the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Prior to the Marine Corps I completed Georgetown University
School of Foreign Service in 1956.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And you received a bachelor of arts degree?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. A bachelor of science, foreign service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. As you undoubtedly know, Mr. Donovan, we have called you here
because we think that you might be able to tell us something about the background
of Lee Harvey Oswald, whom I believe you knew when you were both
members of the Marine Corps.</p>

<p>Why don't you, in your own words, outline your contact with Oswald, and I
will interrupt with questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. In the spring of 1959, I returned from a tour in Japan. I
was assigned to Marine Air Control Squadron 9 in Santa Ana, Calif.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Excuse me. There is something in these service records that confuses
me. Is the installation at Santa Ana separate from the one at El Toro?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. It comes under the command of El Toro, but it is, I believe,
5 miles removed.</p>

<p>El Toro is a jet type base. Santa Ana is still known by the title of "LTA"
which stands for lighter than air, which stems from the fact that in World
War II it was a blimp base. It is now a helicopter base and a radar base.</p>

<p>In that spring, I was the assistant operations officer and the training officer
at Marine Air Control Squadron 9, and it is there that I came into contact
with Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. What was your rank at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. First lieutenant.</p>

<p>Our function at that base was to surveil for aircraft, but basically to train
both enlisted and officers for later assignment overseas. Some of my fellow
officers there had served with Oswald in Japan, and as all ranks, from generals
to privates probably do, they discussed their contemporaries and how to get
along with them.</p>

<p>I was informed that Oswald was very competent, but a little bit nuts on
foreign affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Who told you this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Bill Trail&mdash;William Kenneth Trail is his name&mdash;had served
with him in Japan, and was around when Oswald underwent some court-martial
proceedings, but I don't recall what they were. I don't know if my memory
has been refreshed by the newspaper or if I actually knew then. I don't
believe I recall. At any rate, Oswald served on my crew there, served on a
lot of crews, but basically mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Let me interrupt a moment to define a little more closely the relationship
between you and Oswald.</p>

<p>Would it be a fair characterization to say that you were his commanding
officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No; that is not correct. The commanding officer was a lieutenant
colonel. Oswald served on a crew, a radar crew, and on that crew I
was the officer in command.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I understand. How many men were on the crew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I believe that there were always about three officers and
about seven enlisted men. It varied from time to time. We were supposed
to have 12 enlisted men, but we were seldom up to strength.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. So Oswald would have been one of the six or seven enlisted men
with whom you were in closest contact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Correct. I served with him on a 4-hour watch once a day,
usually five days a week&mdash;sometimes that was the morning watch, sometimes
the afternoon, and sometimes it was a rather extensive night watch.</p>

<p>During night watch, you had to stay up until all aircraft were in. Often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
this was quite boring. And this is when I had the most occasion to talk to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. It amazed me how much you remembered about Oswald in view
of the fact that you were an officer and he was an enlisted man.</p>

<p>Do you think your memory of him is atypical, or would you remember all
the enlisted men in that crew approximately the same?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I would remember, I believe, all of them equally well. Most
of them I had served with in Japan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You had not known Oswald in Japan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. If I knew him in Japan, I don't remember. They played football
on a team that I coached overseas, which to a degree gives you a common
bond.</p>

<p>Number two, these are not typical marine enlisted. They have a much higher
than average IQ. And they speak well on a given subject they are interested
in&mdash;usually women and sports. But it was quite normal in working with them
to talk with them about all subjects.</p>

<p>You were constantly in communication with the center concerning aircraft,
if something was going on you talked to them on the intercommunication system.
And it was quite ordinary to talk to them, standing at the back of the
radar room in off hours.</p>

<p>I think I can remember all the men on that crew pretty well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. All right. I derailed you there for a moment. You had mentioned
what Lieutenant Trail had told you. And I don't think there is any point in
going into that any further.</p>

<p>Well, let me chase down one thing you mentioned. You said that you thought
the enlisted men on this crew were above average in terms of ability for Marine
Corps enlisted men. Would you say that Oswald specifically was more intelligent
than the average enlisted man, or would you just infer this from the fact
that he was chosen for this job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Both. I think he had a given IQ or GCT, General Classification
Test score, that would place him in a position of being there. I also found
him competent in any job I saw him try in the center. Sometimes he surveiled
for unidentified aircraft. Sometimes he surveiled for aircraft in distress.
Sometimes he made plots on the board. Sometimes he relayed information to
other radar sites in the Air Force or Navy. And sometimes he swept the floor
when we were cleaning up getting ready to go home. I found him competent in
all functions.</p>

<p>Sometimes he was a little moody. But I never heard him wise off to a sergeant
or any officer. And in working with most people, as long as they do their job,
if they are moody, that is their business.</p>

<p>He was always neat. He was neat. Sometimes his lack of enthusiasm got
people in dutch, which the other members of the crew did not always appreciate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. When you say he was neat, was your only contact with him in
regard to this crew? In other words, it was not your job to inspect his quarters
or his rifle or his uniform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. His quarters were not exceptionally neat, and I did have occasion
to inspect them.</p>

<p>But he always cleaned up sufficiently so that he passed inspection. I don't
think he was that way by nature. But I think he had figured out that the
Marine Corps demanded this of him. And he at least complied in that respect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you remember an occasion on which he was transferred out
of a quonset hut because of a refusal to clean up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I recall that there was some difficulty. Two or three inspections
had gone badly. And that the other members of his quonset hut said he
was at fault. It is difficult for a sergeant ever to say who is at fault. But
after the complaints came in long enough, I believe he was transferred to another
hut.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. But your general impression is that he was not <span class="locked">especially&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Sloppy&mdash;no; he was not sloppy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I wonder, Mr. Donovan, if you could return to your description of
the way Oswald performed his job, perhaps with particular reference to how
he reacted to stress situations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes. I have been on watch with him when an emergency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
arose, and in turning around and reporting it to the crew chief and to myself&mdash;and
to me, simultaneously, he would tell you what the status of the emergency
was, if anyone could tell, and what he thought the obvious action we should
take. And he was right. There was usually an obvious solution. Then he
waited for you to tell him what to do, and he did it, no matter what you told him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did he remain calm at all times; or was he excitable with regard
to his job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I don't recall him being particularly excitable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would you characterize him as "very cool," or do you think that
might be overstating the case in the other direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I just think in that respect he was normal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did you have occasion to observe the relation between Oswald and
his fellow enlisted men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. At times; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did it seem that he was normal to you with regard to mixing with
his peers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No; he did not share a common interest with them. For better
or for worse, the average young American male in that age is interested in saving
enough money to go buy another beer and get another date. This I don't believe
would characterize him at all. He read a great deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Excuse me. Do you remember anything that he read specifically?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No; I know that the men always told me that he subscribed to
a Russian newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. When you say Russian newspaper, do you recall whether that was
one printed in the Russian language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You never saw that newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I never saw the newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did you ever question Oswald about his reading of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes; I did. And he did not apparently take this stuff as
gospel&mdash;although&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. When you say that, are you implying that it not only was a Russian
newspaper, but it was also a Communist newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes; I implied that. And I felt that he thought this presented
a very different and perhaps equally just side of the international affairs in
comparison with the United States newspapers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Was the paper printed in Russia, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And, of course, you don't know the name of the paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did he tell you at that time why he subscribed to the paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes; he said he was interested in learning Russian. And he
took great pride in the fact that he could speak it. He couldn't prove it by me,
because I don't speak Russian. But he said he could, and his contemporaries
believed he could. As far as I know, he could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. But you also got the idea that he enjoyed this paper for its ideological
content?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. To a degree. I think he enjoyed international affairs in all
respects. He enjoyed studying them. He thought there were many great&mdash;there
were many grave injustices concerning the affairs in the international
situation.</p>

<p>I know that he constantly brought up the idea that our Government must be
run by many incompetent people. And, as I stated, and you have probably read
in your reports or the newspapers, that he was very well versed, at least on the
superficial facts of a given foreign situation.</p>

<p>His bond with me was that I was a recent graduate of the Foreign Service
School, at least fairly well acquainted with situations throughout the world.
And he would take great pride in his ability to mention not only the leader of a
country, but five or six subordinates in that country who held positions of
prominence. He took great pride in talking to a passing officer coming in or out
of the radar center, and in a most interested manner, ask him what he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
of a given situation, listen to that officer's explanation, and say, "Thank you
very much."</p>

<p>As soon as we were alone again, he would say, "Do you agree with that?"</p>

<p>In many cases it was obvious that the officer had no more idea about that
than he did about the polo races&mdash;or polo matches in Australia.</p>

<p>And Oswald would then say, "Now, if men like that are leading us, there is
something wrong&mdash;when I obviously have more intelligence and more knowledge
than that man."</p>

<p>And I think his grave misunderstanding that I tried to help him with is that
these men were Marine officers and supposed to be schooled in the field of warfare
as the Marine Corps knows it, and not as international political analysts.
And in some respects he was probably better informed than most people in the
Marine Corps, namely, on international affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you remember any specific international events or situations
which he questioned officers about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No; not particularly.</p>

<p>I know that Cuba interested him more than most other situations. He was
fairly well informed about Mr. Batista. He referred to atrocities in general,
not in particular. I think that we all know that there were injustices committed
under the Batista administration. And he was against that. And he was
against this sort of dictatorship.</p>

<p>But I never heard him in any way, shape or form confess that he was a
Communist, or that he ever thought about being a Communist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did you hear him express sympathy for Castro specifically?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes&mdash;but, on the other hand, so did Time Magazine at that
time. Harvard accepted him de facto, at face value&mdash;which is one of our better
schools, I suppose. At any rate, what he said about Castro was not an unpopular
belief at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I don't recall any particulars, except that it was a godsend that
somebody had overthrown Batista.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did he ever express to you any desire that he personally would
take part in clearing up injustices, either in Cuba or anywhere else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. He not only never said it to me, I never heard of him saying
it to anyone else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Based on your observation of men throughout your military career,
would you say that Oswald constituted a typical case of someone whose interests
were different from the rest of the enlisted men? Do you think that his loneliness,
his desire to be alone, exceeded that, or would you say it was a more or
less normal thing for somebody interested in other things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Most young men in the Marine Corps, I suppose in all services,
have the common bond that they want to get out. He certainly shared that
common bond with them. I think that was his only common bond. I don't
believe he shared an equal interest in sports. I don't think he shared an equal
intense interest in girls. And although I believe he drank, sometimes to excess,
I don't believe that he shared even that companionship with them consistently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You mentioned that the sort of unit with which you were associated
was one that drew enlisted men of a higher intellectual caliber. For this reason,
were there men in the unit who shared Oswald's interests, or even given this
he was still the only one interested in serious reading?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Not that I know of. But as I have told both the FBI and the
Secret Service, he had living in his barracks a boy whose name I am sorry
I cannot remember, whose nickname was <span class="locked">Beezer&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would the man's name be Roussel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. That is it. He was from Louisiana, I believe. And this boy
fixed me up with his sister who was an airline stewardess. I took her out on
one occasion, I believe that this boy was at least interested enough in Oswald
that he fixed Oswald up with her once. And she related to me that he could
speak Russian, which I had heard before. And she referred to him as kind
of an oddball. You probably have her name and can talk to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Was her name Rosaleen Quinn?</p>

<p>Would that ring a bell? You don't remember?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No, I am sorry, it doesn't ring a bell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. But you feel that if we could locate this woman, she could tell
us something that would be of interest in reconstructing his personality?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. She went out with him once, maybe twice. Maybe more than
that, I don't know about. I don't know if she could or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you remember any fields other than foreign affairs which Oswald
did extensive reading in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No, I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Have you ever stated that Oswald prided himself on knowing the
names of the great philosophers, or would this statement, if attributed to you,
have been a mistake?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No, that is a correct statement. He knew the names of some
philosophers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Is it your feeling that he read philosophy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Manuscripts are available to all of us which mention these
gentlemen's names in support of some idea. Quite often, if you read the philosopher
you see that it is taken out of context.</p>

<p>I only had 2 years of philosophy and 2 years of theology at Georgetown.
But even with that limited amount, it was obvious that he often knew the name,
and that was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you remember any of the philosophers that he did mention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Hegel, which would be appropriate concerning his later action.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Hegel.</p>

<p>Did he mention Marx?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No, I don't recall him&mdash;oh, he must have mentioned Marx, but
I don't ever recall him using Marxist philosophy to support anything in
particular.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Is it your general impression that the philosophers who interested
him were ones that were somehow tied in with political philosophy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Social revolutions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you know whether Oswald had any knowledge of languages other
than Russian and English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No, I do not. I recall that we had occasion to speak Spanish
on the radio, because ham operators from Mexico were forever cutting in. He
may have known a few words. But he did not&mdash;I don't believe he had a command
of Spanish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You have no recollection of his speaking or understanding German
at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I have no recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did he ever speak to you about his plans for after he got out of
the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No, I cannot say that he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did he ever express to you an interest in attending school anywhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes, now that you mention it; I think he did mention that he
intended to pursue school. And, in fact, it was standard for all officers to encourage
any enlisted man to attend school. He certainly had the ability, if
he had wanted to do it.</p>

<p>There was another boy named Sergeant Park, from Washington, who, I believe,
lived in his same quonset hut, who definitely intended to attend school. I have
given this gentleman's name to both the FBI and the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did Oswald ever mention to you that he would like to attend school
in any foreign country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Never. It came as a complete surprise to me that he had
turned up in Moscow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. In fact, he never mentioned thoughts of traveling at all anywhere
outside the country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. He never mentioned it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did you ever hear of his mentioning it to anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I never heard of it being mentioned to anyone. Evidently
that was a rather well kept secret, that he intended to depart so suddenly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You mentioned that Oswald spoke of injustices which took place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
during the Batista regime. Do you remember his referring to any other country
specifically with regard to injustices?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No, I don't, except for Asia in general. I think in talking
with the FBI and the Secret Service I mentioned Guatemala or something, and
I tried to tell them that was only an example, that I never heard him specifically
refer to Guatemala, or Venezuela, or wherever I was talking with them about.</p>

<p>But he had served in the Orient, and he had seen poverty in the extreme,
as anyone who goes to the Orient does, and he had mentioned that that was
unjust.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did you notice any specific interest in Latin America?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes. I would say that he was particularly interested in Latin
America. He, for instance, was relatively familiar with the Betancourt family,
which is a prominent North, South American and Central American family,
and their regime as a family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did he ever mention the Dominican Republic by name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. If he did, I don't recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did he ever have any specific suggestions as to what should be
done about problems in Asia or Latin America?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No. His only solution that I could see was that authority,
particularly the Marine Corps, ought to be able to recognize talent such as
his own, without a given magic college degree, and put them in positions of
prominence. His talent was obviously unrecognized by the Marine Corps for
commission or staff NCO ability, if it existed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. This is his opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. This is his opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You mentioned that Oswald did not, in your view, have an inordinate
interest in competitive sports.</p>

<p>Do you remember any excursions into the field of competitive sports?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes; he went out for the squadron football team, and I believe
he played end. As I stated before, he often tried to make calls in the
huddle&mdash;for better or for worse, again, I should say, a quarterback is in charge
of the team and should make the calls. A quarterback did. And I don't know
if he quit or I kicked him off. But, at any rate, he stopped playing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Let me make a comment with regard to something you said.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly there are many things you covered with the FBI and the Secret
Service. We now have to bring them out under oath, so we can introduce them
into the record of the Commission. So we know we are being repetitive. We
will just ask you to bear with us on this.</p>

<p>Were you the captain of this team?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No; I was the coach of the team. The captain was a gentleman
named Tibbet Czik, and Captain Czik is still on active duty in the Marine
Corps. Last summer he was stationed at New River, N.C. And Captain Czik
would not remember this fellow very well, because at that time he was recently
reinstated in the Marine Corps after having been out for a few years.
He knew at that time very little about radar and was in a more or less student
status. I don't believe he would remember him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Was Czik the quarterback?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Czik was the quarterback. Czik was the quarterback all
through college of some college in New Jersey, and had a lot of talent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Was Oswald a proficient football player?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No; he had his share of ability. But he was too light. I think
the boy only weighed about 125, 130 pounds, as I remember. He had a slender
build.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would you say, however, that he was normal in terms of speed
and agility?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Oh, yes; he was fast enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. So would you characterize him as athletic, but too light to be a
really good football player?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I don't think that he would ever make first string high school
in a good high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. On any kind of team, or are you just speaking about football?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Football. I never saw him play basketball that I recall, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
he might have been talented in that field. He was coordinated to a
normal degree.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did you notice any special lack of team spirit on his part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes; like the other experiences I had with him, he thought he
should be boss, and when he was not immediately accepted as such, there was
discontent on his part, which, of course, is lack of team spirit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You mentioned earlier that you at times inspected Oswald's quarters.
Did you have occasion to inspect his rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes; I did. And I don't recall anything out of order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Are you saying that you don't recall the results of this inspection,
or that you do recall the results of the inspection and that you don't remember
that his rifle was extraordinarily sloppy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I don't recall that his rifle was extraordinarily sloppy. I
do recall, after having talked with you about it, the barracks incident, in which
there was some discontent on the part of his contemporaries that the hut was
being punished for his lack of order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. But your impression is that he kept his rifle as neat as anybody
else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I don't recall to the contrary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would you have any reason to have an impression as to Oswald's
proficiency in firing the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No; I would not. I saw his record book, and I believe at
that time he was qualified as a sharpshooter&mdash;or maybe a marksman. If he
had not been qualified as a marksman, which is the minimum standard, I am
sure I would have been aware of it, because I was training officer, and that is
one of the things that you must try to train men in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. But you never had occasion to be with him when he fired a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. The marksmanship scores which are recorded in the Marine Corps&mdash;are
they reliable, or is there an opportunity to falsify a score?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I would say that in a vast majority of the cases they are
reliable. Some people have what is called an M-1 pencil&mdash;namely, you can
punch holes in the target the size of an M-1 shell to improve the score. This
is a court-martial offense. I am sure it does happen.</p>

<p>I don't personally know of it ever having happened, but it might. If he had
a score of 210, which would make him sharpshooter, I would assume that from
the standing position he could hit a 10-inch bullseye 8 times out of 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you know how the score was recorded? Did the firer of the
weapon ever go down personally to inspect the target?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Never. That is one of the things that makes this quite difficult.
The men are on a firing range, a minimum of 200 yards distance, a maximum
of 800 yards distance. When you are put into what is called the butts,
or the target area, you do not know whose target you are pulling, because they
switch you around every day. A staff NCO or an officer comes around and
verifies each given shot. And it is not impossible to cheat, but it would be
most difficult to. And I have no reason to suspect that he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. In order that a friend could cheat for you, he would have to know
ahead of time which point you were firing on, get to that point, and punch the
target before the NCO got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. That is correct. You fired from a given position every day.</p>

<p>For instance, if you fired on target 17 during the week or two of qualification,
you always fired on target 17. However, in the target area, where you pulled
the targets up and down to repair them, you were switched from spot to spot
every day, and it was not a matter of choice. The sergeant just said, "You men
take target 1", "target 2," and so on. So it would be most unusual.</p>

<p>But I suppose it does happen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Earlier in your deposition you stated, I believe, that you never
heard Oswald wise off to any NCO. When speaking to the FBI, did you characterize
him as a wise guy, or is that the agent's characterization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. He was a wise guy in the sense that he could be disrespectful
in a way that you would accept. He would in a very respectful manner argue
with someone and in most cases it was obvious to people listening that he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
more than the person he was arguing with. We had one fellow on our crew,
a S. Sgt. Cornelius Brown, and Sergeant Brown is the most competent sergeant
in the field of radar that I have ever encountered. Sergeant Brown could
barely write. He could read, but again barely read. He could read a newspaper.</p>

<p>But most people like to think they are well informed on all subjects. And
it was characteristic of Oswald to bait people, particularly on foreign affairs.
He would listen interestedly, ask questions in an interested manner, and then
if the person were not too high in rank, could point out a dozen places they
didn't know what they were talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you feel that he ever asked questions about foreign affairs because
he truly wanted to know the person's opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No; I think his mind was made up. I think he wanted to
ask questions to later expose to his comrades that he knew far more than a
person in a position of authority. I think he tried to make it evident to his
contemporaries that in many cases he was more gifted and more intelligent than
people who were in charge of him. And this in itself was ridiculous&mdash;according
to his way of thinking. I don't think that he ever asked information of
anyone on foreign affairs, including me, whose opinion he particularly respected.
He had his mind made up and was willing to discuss that point of view with
anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. How did Oswald's fellow enlisted men react to his baiting of
NCOs and officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Well, sometimes, if he tried to humiliate the sergeant in the
presence of others, the sergeant has many ways of getting even, and he can
make a cleanup detail much more detailed, he can make barracks inspections
much more frequently, and I don't think this particularly made his fellow
marines enthusiastic about his attitude.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you think his fellow marines accepted his view that he was
brighter than the officers he was talking to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes; I think that they accepted the view that he was brighter
than most people, and was particularly capable in the field of world affairs.
In respect to them, I think he knew more than they did, at least in facts.</p>

<p>I think they admired his ability to pursue Russian on his own and learn it.
And I think anyone must admit that this reflects a degree of intelligence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. While you and Oswald were in the same unit, was he ever in any
trouble of a nature which would require administrative action?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Returning to this date that you had with this airline stewardess, did
she tell you anything about Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. As I recall, the only thing she said was that he was rather
strange. And I do recall that either she or her brother at that time mentioned
that he does speak Russian and reads Russian newspapers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did she say in what way he was strange?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I don't recall in what way she said he was strange.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did you get the feeling that she hadn't enjoyed herself when she
was with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I got that impression. But I think that they didn't share any
common interest. I think he was truly interested in international affairs, and
that is not typical of her or other stewardesses I have known.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you recall the circumstances under which Oswald left the
Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Could you relate them to us, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I recall that he got a hardship discharge. We offered to get
him a flight&mdash;that is a hop from El Toro to some place in Texas, his home. He
refused. We considered that normal in that if you take a hop you sacrifice
your transportation pay. We offered to take him to a bus or train station. He
refused. But that is not particularly unusual, either.</p>

<p>I recall that he was gone for some period of time, and shortly before I got
out of the Marine Corps, which was mid-December 1959, we received word that
he had showed up in Moscow. This necessitated a lot of change of aircraft
call signs, codes, radio frequencies, radar frequencies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
He had the access to the location of all bases in the west coast area, all
radio frequencies for all squadrons, all tactical call signs, and the relative
strength of all squadrons, number and type of aircraft in a squadron, who was
the commanding officer, the authentication code of entering and exiting the
ADIZ, which stands for Air Defense Identification Zone. He knew the range
of our radar. He knew the range of our radio. And he knew the range of the
surrounding units' radio and radar.</p>

<p>If you had asked me a month after I left that area, I could not have told
you any but our own. Had I wanted to record them, I certainly could have
secretly, and taken them with me. Unless he intentionally with malice aforethought
wrote them down, I doubt if he would have been able to recall them a
month later, either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You recall that various codes were changed. Now, at what level
were these changed? Was this an action of your specific unit, or a fairly
widespread action?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Well, I did not witness the changing in any other squadrons,
but it would have to be, because the code is obviously between two or more
units. Therefore, the other units had to change it. These codes are a grid,
and two lines correspond.</p>

<p>And he gives the grid that you want, and he reads back "AB," or whatever
the reply is supposed to be, the authentication is supposed to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Are authentication codes changed from time to time as a matter
of course?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. They are changed from time to time, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Are they changed even if there is no specific incident which elicits
the change?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. They are methodically changed anyway. There are some
things which he knew on which he received instruction that there is no way
of changing, such as the MPS 16 height-finder radar gear. That had recently
been integrated into the Marine Corps system. It had a height-finding range
far in excess of our previous equipment, and it has certain limitations. He
had been schooled on those limitations.</p>

<p>It cannot operate above a given altitude in setting&mdash;in other words, you
cannot place the thing above a given terrain height.</p>

<p>He had also been schooled on a piece of machinery called a TPX-1, which
is used to transfer radio&mdash;radar and radio signals over a great distance. Radar
is very susceptible to homing missiles, and this piece of equipment is used to
put your radar antenna several miles away, and relay the information back
to your site which you hope is relatively safe. He had been schooled on this.</p>

<p>And that kind of stuff you cannot change.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did Oswald have any kind of clearance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. He must have had secret clearance to work in the radar center,
because that was a minimum requirement for all of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Was the spot at which he worked such that in order to gain admittance
one would have to show some sort of credentials?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes; they checked your card data. Within the center, which
is called a counter-air operations center, he rotated through all positions of an
enlisted man. At times, as I told you, he served as plotter, sometimes surveillance,
sometimes even as crew chief.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Were you the one who picked the crew chief?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I was in a rather favorable position, since I was the training
officer and assistant operations officer, that I had first choice of crew chiefs.
I always picked one of two men&mdash;either Sgt. Cornelius Brown or Sgt. Eugene
Holmburg. I have already told you where Sergeant Brown is.</p>

<p>Sergeant Holmburg is now a commissioned warrant officer and still on
active duty in the Marine Corps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did you ever pick Oswald to act as crew chief?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. There was occasion when Oswald acted as crew chief. If
one of these sergeants had another duty somewhere else, and Oswald was senior
man present, he was crew chief. And I had no complaint about his work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did he show any special ability in this direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes; I think he was competent, very competent. And I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
he did his job well. I don't recall anything coming up that he could not handle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. In acting as crew chief, do you think he demonstrated leadership
qualities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I don't think he was a leader.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. However, is it fair to say that any reservations you have about
his ability as a leader were not sufficient to make you decide never to use him
as a crew chief again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I would not hesitate to use him as a crew chief.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. When the other men in the unit found out that Oswald was in the
process of getting a hardship discharge, did they make any offers to help, other
than the ones you have mentioned concerning transportation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I recall that I offered to help him any way I could, including
financially. And you can talk to Sergeant Brown, but I believe that Sergeant
Brown helped him, or offered to help him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did he accept these offers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. He did not from me, and to the best of my knowledge he did
not from anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did he give a reason for refusing them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. He didn't need the help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did you find out about his attempt to get a hardship discharge
through observation of his papers, or did he mention it to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I have no idea. I don't recall seeing any papers. Just word
around the squadron.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would you have any idea of how long in advance of his actual
discharge you or others heard about the fact that he was trying to get a
discharge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did he ever discuss with you the reasons for the discharge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I don't recall if he ever discussed them or not. I did know
that his mother needed help. And, at that time, I recall that I believed he
was a sole surviving son. Since that date I have read that he has a brother.
At that time, as I recall, I believed him to be an only son, and his mother needed
help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did you observe on the part of Oswald anything that could be termed
mental instability?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No; except that he had an extreme passion for this field of
foreign affairs&mdash;or at least in his discussions with me&mdash;and they might have
been limited to me, I don't know. But it is unusual when anyone is solely
interested in one given thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. During discussions of foreign affairs, did he get visibly angry, did
he raise his voice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No; he never raised his voice, but he could become passionate
in the defense of a point, and become quite enthusiastic in trying to get you
to see what he saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. But he always retained physical control of himself, in terms of
pounding the table, screaming?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Oh, yes; I don't believe he became any more physically worked
up than people we talk with every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did you observe Oswald to complain about the Marine Corps any
more than the average Marine complains about the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No; he stuck in my mind in that respect only because
he was particularly opposed to the recognition promotion program. Most guys
complain about having to stand so many inspections, having to clean up the
barracks so many times, having to go on KP so many times, et cetera.</p>

<p>I don't recall those complaints from him. They may have come. The
complaint he had was that the Marine Corps did not recognize his ability to
to be in a position of command. I recall that on several instances I encouraged
him to pursue this, and put in for NCO leadership school, if he felt he had
the qualities, or to go out, get a commission, and come back in, and try to do
his best in that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you know whether he ever took an OCS qualification exam?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I do not recall that he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you recall any interest on Oswald's part in music?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Fine. I am going to run down a list of short questions like that,
and the answer to many of them may be simply that you don't remember.
These are things that have been suggested to us.</p>

<p>Do you recall whether or not he played chess?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes; I do recall. I have played chess with him some nights.
And, as a matter of fact, he was a pretty good chess player. I won the base
championship that year in chess. I know that on occasion he beat me. That
was not a very big base. But he and I were comparable players. I think I
beat him more times than I lost to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did he ever have occasion to discuss with you his religious beliefs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I don't recall that he ever expressed any belief in God.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you recall that <span class="locked">he&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I don't recall that he ever expressed any denial of God.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Never mentioned the subject at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. If he did, I don't recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you recall his getting into any fights while he and you were at
Santa Ana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I do not recall his getting into any fights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I believe you mentioned earlier that he did not seem to you particularly
interested in girls.</p>

<p>Was this just because he was interested in other things, or do you have any
reason to believe that there was anything abnormal about his desires?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I have no reason to suspect that he was homosexual, and in
that squadron at that time one fellow was discharged from the service for being
homosexual. He was in no way tied in with it that I know of. His lack of
interest in girls may be only my belief, because as an officer I cannot have occasion
to know him socially, but in our conversations he never was particularly
interested in talking about them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you know whether he smoked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would you say that he had a good sense of humor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. If my sense of humor is good, he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did he attempt to be funny?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. He attempted it at times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And, in your opinion, failed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. And in my opinion he was a failure in that respect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You have mentioned that he read a Russian newspaper. Do you
remember any other possessions or habits or affectations which would suggest
an interest in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No, I do not.</p>

<p>However, I do recall that in college we had some monumentally boring textbooks
to read concerning GATT, et cetera&mdash;at least at the time they were monumentally
boring. And on occasion he would bring up one of these books&mdash;I don't
recall which one&mdash;but say, "Are you familiar with this?" And it was my good
fortune to have studied it. And he would ask about something. And in some
respects he would ask you about a term he did not know. But he never would
ask you about a concept, except in an effort to get you to discuss it or argue it.
But he would ask you what some word meant in economics. He was interested in
international economics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Could you state for the record what GATT stands for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. General Agreement on Trade and Tariff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you recall his having any nicknames?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. What were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Ozzie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did most people call him Ozzie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Or Oz.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did you ever know or hear of his being in contact with the Cuban
consulate, either in person or by mail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I never heard of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you remember <span class="locked">whether&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Are you talking about then, or now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I am talking about then, right.</p>

<p>Do you recall whether he made any trips, when he had time off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes; I think he took a couple of trips down to Tijuana, but I
don't think those were for reasons of studying international economics, although
they might well have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did he ever tell you what he did in Tijuana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Never, and I never inquired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you know whether he took any trips to Los Angeles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I don't know it, but I am sure he did, because it was common for
all those boys to go in and out of Los Angeles or Hollywood, or up to Disneyland&mdash;whether
they wanted to go up for a beer or a date or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did you notice that he either took more trips than the average marine,
or that he took fewer trips?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I did not recognize his itinerary as being anything out of the
ordinary in that respect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you remember his receiving any visitors while he was at Santa
Ana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I do not recall his receiving any visitors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Does the name Lieutenant Cupenak mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Means absolutely nothing to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Cupenak does not even sound like any name that means anything
to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes, I knew a Lieutenant John Cuaka. C-u-a-k-a. That spelling
is strictly phonetic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Was he at Santa Ana at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I do not believe he was. I knew him in the Philippines and in
Japan. He was a radar maintenance officer that generally served with a GCA,
standing for Ground Control Approach unit. But Cupenak doesn't ring a bell at
all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Finally, Mr. Donovan, I would like to get your opinion on which of
the men who were at Santa Ana at the time that both you and Oswald were
there would be most helpful to us in reconstructing the personality of Oswald.
I will mention the names that I have to you, and see whether you <span class="locked">think&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. You mean which in the plural or singular? You want me to
say which would be <span class="locked">most&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I will read the names to you, and you can comment on them individually.</p>

<p>Do you remember a man named Thornley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I don't recall the name at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. All right.</p>

<p>How about a man named Lewis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Don't recall the name at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Botelho?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes, Botelho was a man in our squadron. I cannot recall his
face. But I do recall the man being in our squadron. And he went by the
nickname, normally enough, of Bo.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you remember whether or not he knew Oswald well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No, I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you remember a man named Call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I certainly do. He is from Allentown, Pa. I tried to look
him up after my discharge. I was passing through his town. He was a corporal,
later sergeant, I believe, buck sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you recall whether he knew Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. He must have. Call was another boy I played chess with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would you characterize Call as an intellectual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I would characterize Call as being modestly intelligent&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>modestly
not referring to his degree of intelligence, but in reference to his
character concerning his intelligence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you remember a man named Delgado?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I certainly do&mdash;quite well. Delgado was on my crew. He was
one of the boys that used to speak with the Mexican ham operators to ask them
to leave the air when we were talking to aircraft. And Delgado had a command
of Mexican more than Spanish. Delgado was a very dependable boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you think he would be able to help us concerning Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. He could tell you much more about Oswald's personal life
than I can, because he lived in the same barracks area with him; Delgado played
on the football team. He many times served on the same crew with Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you remember a man named Murray?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes, Murray was a clerk. He had a radar specialization number,
but we used him as a clerk. And, as I recall, he wanted to go back to
medical school. I think he was from the South somewhere, I believe. Very
efficient, very intelligent, very competent, capable man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you recall whether he knew Oswald well, or would it be fair to
say that all the men on the crew would know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Well, Murray I don't think you would say was on the crew so
much. Murray, because of his administrative ability, worked more in the office.
Murray was married. And that puts him in a little different light, too. I think
he was very happily married. At the end of the day he went home&mdash;whereas
Oswald stayed in the barracks area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you remember a man named Powers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. The name rings a bell, but I don't really remember him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Osborne?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you recall whether Osborne was an acquaintance of Oswald's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes. Osborne I knew quite well. He played football with us
for some time. He must have known him. I don't know if he actually lived in
the same barracks. He knew him. I don't know how well he knew him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Now, you have mentioned Captain Trail to us, and also Sergeant
Brown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Captain Trail was Lieutenant Trail when I knew him. I think
he is now Captain Trail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Yes. Can you think of any other names that neither you nor I have
already mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. Yes; another fellow that I am sure knew him was a fellow
named Elmer Ellsworth Randolph. And he is now a salesman for Brock Candy
Co., somewhere in the Chicago area.</p>

<p>Another fellow that probably knows him is now on active duty&mdash;Fred Walker.
He is a captain. I believe Walker knew him.</p>

<p>Captain Block, Robert Block, was the operations officer at that time. I don't
know if he would remember Oswald or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you recall whether Oswald ever went to night clubs? Bars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I think he used to go down to the enlisted men's club to drink
beer. I recall going down there one night to talk to some boys on a disturbance
and I vaguely remember him being there, but I would not swear to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would you have any personal knowledge of whether he attended
offpost bars or night clubs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No, I would not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did he drink more than the average marine, the same amount, less?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I believed not. However, after the assassination of President
Kennedy, I talked to Lieutenant Trail on the phone and Trail told me that he
had been mixed up in some drinking bouts in Japan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. But from your <span class="locked">own&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. From my own personal knowledge, I do not know that he
drank to excess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. But he did drink some?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. I don't ever recall seeing him drink. But as I recall the conversation,
I believe he did. But I don't know that for a fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Well, in that case, Mr. Donovan, I think that is all the questions I
have for you.</p>

<p>Do you think of anything else that might be helpful to us in trying to figure
out what sort of a man Oswald was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. There is one name that you did not mention that I know that
lived in the same barracks he did. Cpl. Sherman Cooley. He also served on
that crew. I served with Cooley overseas, and in Santa Ana. Cooley is another
fellow that was intelligent, but very modest about it.</p>

<p>The reason I remember his first name, it always struck me as strange that
someone named Sherman would live in Louisiana.</p>

<p>Another boy's name is Dejanovich. That is phonetic. Dejanovich lived in
Chicago, and after I was discharged from the service I called him on the phone
a couple of times, passing through there.</p>

<p>Another guy that would know him is a boy named Jurarado, I believe. I
don't know how much these boys knew about him. They are just people that
were there at the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Your mention of Dejanovich reminds me of a question I intended to
ask you.</p>

<p>Do you recall any of Oswald's former marines calling him Oswaldovich, or
anything that sounded like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you recall fellow marines referring to him as "Comrade?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Donovan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Well, if you have nothing more to add, Mr. Donovan, on behalf of
the Commission, I would like to thank you for giving us your time and testimony.
It has been very helpful.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="t303"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_ALLISON_G_FOLSOM_LT_COL_USMC" id="TESTIMONY_OF_ALLISON_G_FOLSOM_LT_COL_USMC">TESTIMONY OF ALLISON G. FOLSOM, LT. COL., USMC</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Allison G. Folsom, Lt. Col., USMC, was taken at 1:15 p.m.,
on May 1, 1964, at 200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C., by Mr. John
Hart Ely, member of the staff of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Colonel, would you please stand up and be sworn?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. My name is John Ely. I am a member of the legal staff of the
President's Commission investigating the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Staff members have been authorized to take the testimony of witnesses by the
Commission pursuant to authority granted to the Commission by Executive
Order No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution of Congress
No. 137.</p>

<p>Under the Commission rules for the taking of testimony, each witness is to
be provided with a copy of the Executive order and of the joint resolution and a
copy of the rules that the Commission has adopted governing the taking of testimony
from witnesses. I have provided you with these documents, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. This is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Under the Commission's rules for the taking of testimony, each
witness is entitled to 3 days' notice before he is required to come in and give
testimony.</p>

<p>You did not have 3 days' notice. However, each witness can waive that
notice requirement if he wishes, and I assume that your presence here indicates
you are willing to waive that notice requirement.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. It is waived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would you state your full name, please?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Lt. Col. Allison G. Folsom, Jr., U.S. Marine Corps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. What is your job in the Marine Corps, sir?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. My primary duty is head, Records Branch, Personnel Department,
Headquarters U.S. Marine Corps, Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. How long have you held this position?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Approximately 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Could you give us something of an idea of your background&mdash;what
you did before you entered the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. I was a student.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And how long have you been in the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. I entered active duty in the Marine Corps 5 August 1935.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Prior to the assassination of President Kennedy, had you ever heard
the name Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Could you tell us in what connection that was?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. It was in connection with his record, which was requested by
the Discipline Branch of Headquarters, Marine Corps, and they advised me of
his renunciation, I would guess, of his citizenship, and the fact that they were
trying to effect his discharge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I see. And that is the first time you had ever heard of him?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did you ever meet the man?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. All right. The primary reason that we have called you here, colonel,
is not because of any contact which you have had with Oswald, but because of
your position. We have here Oswald's Marine records, and we would like you
to help us interpret some of the abbreviations, test scores and things like that.</p>

<p>Let me show you this document, which we will mark Folsom Deposition Exhibit
No. 1, and ask you if you can tell us what it is.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Folsom Deposition Exhibit No. 1 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. It represents a photostatic copy of the official record held by
the Marine Corps of Lee Harvey Oswald, former marine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Our procedure now will be to go through the document which you
have just identified. I have numbered the pages of this document in the upper
right-hand corner.</p>

<p>We will ask you to explain things as we come to them. Starting on page 1 of
Exhibit No. 1, first I wonder if you might tell us what Oswald's scores here under
the category of Physical Profile mean.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Well, the classification of "A" indicates that there were no
physical defects at the time he was examined&mdash;the date, 24 October 1956, I
assume, was upon his enlistment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Yes; moving down the left side of page 1, we have the abbreviation
"PEBD." Will you tell us what that stands for?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Pay entry base date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I note that the pay entry base date on Oswald's record has been
changed from 24 October 1956 to 8 December 1956. Why would this be?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. That is correct. This was changed to reflect time lost due to
misconduct, confinement, or intemperate use of drugs or alcohol. In this instance
it was days lost due to confinement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Also on page 1 it is noted that Oswald was a "UQ" class swimmer.
What does that stand for?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Unqualified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Finally on page 1, at the bottom, there is written in the fact that
among the documents inserted in the record are some relating to "SA" action.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Supervisory authority action in a court-martial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I show you now page 3 of this exhibit. Could you tell us generally
what this page of the record is.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Page 3 of the Marine Corps Enlisted Service Record constitutes
a record of primary duty assignments, the organization to which the individual
was attached, with the dates, and also shows conduct and proficiency
markings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. In connection with these conduct and proficiency markings, could
you tell us what the scale is on which these grades are assigned?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. The Marine Corps marks on a scale of from 0 to 5.0.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. 5.0 is the maximum grade?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And what would be the minimum satisfactory grade? Is there no
minimum?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. No; there is none as such, because the markings are averaged
at the end of the enlistment, and in accordance with existing regulations, the
numerical quality of the markings determine the difference in the character of
discharge between honorable and under honorable conditions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you know what the minimum average for an honorable discharge
would be?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. I believe&mdash;was the question under honorable conditions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Well, what would be the minimum for an honorable discharge?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. 4.0.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, I would like to take up some of these abbreviations specifically. I think
the easiest way to designate this would be to go down the various columns on this
page. Now, the column on the extreme left is labeled "organization." I shall ask
you about the ones which I think might be unclear to somebody looking at this
exhibit. There is an abbreviation here, after Oswald left Jacksonville, he was
transferred to a unit abbreviated CASCO HQBN HQMC. Would you tell us
what that stands for?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. That indicates he was attached to the Casual Company,
Headquarters Battalion, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps, at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Now, this would have been while he <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. He joined on 4 May 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Yes; I believe it was during the time he was at Keesler Air Force
Base.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Yes; undergoing duty under instruction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Moving to the "reason" column on this page, we have here an entry
of 27 October 1957, which is abbreviated, "To Sk." What does that stand for?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. To sick. He was admitted to the U.S. Naval Hospital
Yokosuka, Japan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And the entry directly below that one, which is abbreviated "To Du"
would mean return to duty?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. The entry directly below the To Duty entry which is abbreviated
"SEMIAN" would indicate what?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. That it was a semiannual marking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. In other words, this is an entry strictly for marking purposes?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And the entry directly below that is abbreviated "To Cnfd."</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. To confinement. In this instance, serving sentence summary
court-martial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Moving now to the next column, labeled "Primary Duty," one abbreviation
which recurs is "DUINS." Could you tell us what that means?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Duty under instruction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And the entry of 12 September 1957 has an abbreviation which I
believe refers to the sort of job which Oswald was performing. Could you tell us
what that stands for?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. In this case he was a replacement trainee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Well, that is the entry for 9 July 1957. That stands for replacement
trainee. Could you tell us what the entry for 12 September 1957 is?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. It indicates that he joined Marine Air Control Squadron,
No. 1, Marine Air Group 11, First Marine Aircraft Wing, Fleet Marine Force, care
of "FPO" San Francisco. This is a mailing address for an organization in the
First Wing which at that time was in Japan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And what was the job that he performed?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. He was an aviation electronics operator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. All right. I think that with the help you have given us, anybody
looking over this record which appears at page 3 and 4 of the Folsom Deposition
Exhibit No. 1 could readily understand the progress of Oswald's service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
Turning now to page 5 of the exhibit, I notice that before Oswald was
awarded his final MOS, he was awarded an MOS, that is a Military Occupational
Specialty, of 6400. Do you know, Colonel, what that stands for?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. It is a basic MOS in aviation electronics, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Now, we have an entry at the bottom of page 5 of this exhibit which
was later crossed out. Could you explain to us the meaning of that entry?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Yes. This is an entry that is additional information as to
promotion status on transfer to a new organization. This entry shows that
Oswald achieved a composite score for the second 1958 testing period of 113.
The reason it was deleted was due to his reduction from the rank of private first
class to private pursuant to sentence of a summary court-martial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Is there any way of evaluating his score of 113?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. It would be very difficult to reconstruct it. It is a composition
of conduct and proficiency markings, time in service, and time in grade.
And promotions are based on cutting scores established by Headquarters Marine
Corps, which are promulgated to the field, and individuals holding the cutting
score or higher may be promoted by their local organizations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. But the cutting score which is promulgated varies from time to time?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. It fluctuates. Well, it does not fluctuate&mdash;it is controlled
by a staff agency at Headquarters, Marine Corps, to fulfill the needs of the
Marine Corps by&mdash;in the varying grades.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Turning our attention now to page 6 of the exhibit, I notice here
in the section labeled "Allotments" that toward the end of Oswald's Marine
Corps career his mother received two allotments. These two allotments are
designated differently in terms of purpose&mdash;one being given a "Q" designation
and the other being given a "D" designation.</p>

<p>Can you explain what the difference is?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. The "Q" allotment is one where a portion of it is provided
by the Government, and the other portion by the individual. It is a dependency
allotment.</p>

<p>The "D" allotment, I believe, is an additional voluntary contribution.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. The "D" allotment is one that the individual marine decides to send
out of his pay?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Immediately below the allotment section is the record of Oswald's
firing of various weapons. We would like you to explain some of the abbreviations
found in this record.</p>

<p>Under the column "Course" we see that at one point he fired the M-1 Rifle on
a so-called "A" course, and, too, he fired it on a "B" course. Could you tell
us what the difference is between those two courses?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Yes; the "A" course is the standard marksmanship qualification
course used by the Marine Corps for the M-1 Rifle. The "B" course is
a shorter course&mdash;by that, less rounds of ammunition are fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. But both of these courses are such that one can record a score?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Yes; there are scores and adjective designations as a result
of the scores.</p>

<p>In the case of the "A" course, Oswald obtained a score of 212 which would,
under regulations in effect at that time, have made him a sharpshooter. However,
the score of 212 was erroneously designated with the abbreviation "MM"
for marksman.</p>

<p>When he fired the "B" course, he is rated "MM" or marksman, and this is a
correct designation in accordance with the score fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Am I correct in stating that when he fired the "A" course he would
have been still in basic training at San Diego?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. This was on the 21st of December 1958. Did you mention what
the minimum score for sharpshooter would have been at that point?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. It would have been 210.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. In other words, he was two points over the minimum for sharpshooter
and the designation "MM" on his record was an error?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Am I correct in stating that the "B" course firing to which you
referred occurred on May 6, 1959, at El Toro, Calif.?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. This is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. His record also discloses that he fired a riot gun, a .45 caliber
pistol, and at some times an M-1 rifle on a course designated "FAM." That
stands for familiarization?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And that means that no <span class="locked">scores&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. No score is recorded. It is merely to familiarize the people
with the operation of the weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. When you speak of ratings of sharpshooter and marksman, is it
correct that the scale runs&mdash;marksman is the lowest, sharpshooter the next
highest, and expert would be the highest category?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Turning now to page 7 of the exhibit, which is titled "Military and
Civilian Occupational Specialties and Education," I see hereabout halfway down
the left column abbreviations for the courses taken by Oswald, first while he
was at Jacksonville, and then while he was at Keesler Air Force Base. Could
you tell us the meanings of these two abbreviations?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Yes; at Jacksonville he was undergoing instruction in
aviation fundamentals school, course "P." And at Keesler Air Force Base, he
was undergoing a course of instruction in air control and warning operator's
course. Both of these courses were of 6 weeks' duration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I am a little curious about Keesler Air Force Base. Is that under
the auspices of the Air Force rather than the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Yes; it is an Air Force School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And do people from all branches of the service get trained there?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Yes; we have cross training with all the other services.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. All right. Now, moving further down page 7, we have the record
of a Russian examination taken by Oswald on February 25, 1959. Could you
explain to us what sort of test this was, and what the scores achieved by Oswald
mean?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. The test form was Department of the Army, Adjutant General's
Office, PRT-157. This is merely the test series designation.</p>

<p>Now, under "understands" the scoring was minus 5, which means that he got
five more wrong than right. The "P" in parentheses indicates "poor." Under
reading he achieved a score of 4, which is low. This, again, is shown by the
"P" in parentheses for "poor."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. This 4 means he got four more questions right than wrong?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. This is correct.</p>

<p>And under "writes" he achieved a score of 3, with "P" in parentheses, and this
indicates he got three more right than he did wrong.</p>

<p>His total score was 2, with a "P" in parentheses meaning that overall he got
two more right than wrong, and his rating was poor throughout.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Page 7 also summarizes the results of the battery of classification
and aptitude tests taken by Oswald upon his entry into the Marine Corps,
specifically on October 30, 1956. This battery was composed of six examinations.</p>

<p>Oswald's scores I see range from as low as 92 to as high as 125.</p>

<p>Could you, Colonel, tell us about these six categories, what they are, and
what Oswald's scores in each of them means?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Yes. I will take this in sequence.</p>

<p>The "RV" indicates reading and vocabulary, and the score, Roman numeral
II-125 indicates that he was in the second category. Categories throughout the
test battery run from I to IV, with IV being the highest.</p>

<p>The abbreviation "AC"&mdash;arithmetical computation&mdash;and the score Roman
numeral III-108, indicates that he dropped into the third class.</p>

<p>"AR" is arithmetical computation, Roman numeral III-90, indicates that he
was at the bottom of the Grade 3 in this area.</p>

<p>"PA" indicates pattern analysis, Roman numeral III-94 indicates that he was
the bottom portion of the third group in this category.</p>

<p>Now, these four areas are grouped into a general classification test score,
the abbreviation "GCT" represents that definition. And as a result of Oswald's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
composite scores, he was graded as a Grade 3, Roman III-103. At that time, the
Marine Corps average, I believe, was 107.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would you explain the one designated "RCT"?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. The abbreviation "RCT" is&mdash;represents radio code test.
There are three scores in this, ranging from one to three, with one being the
highest. The minimum, or the range in Grade III is from 90 to 109. As Oswald
achieved 92, he was in the bottom, practically, of Group III.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Which is the lowest group.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Which is the lowest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Now, directing your attention to page 8, which is a summary court
memorandum: this relates, I believe, to his first court-martial, and in general
is self-explanatory. I want, however, to ask you about one sentence which to
me seems to be in error.</p>

<p>According to the notation made here on page 8, under the title "Convening
Authorities Action Dated," it states that that part of Oswald's sentence confining
him at hard labor for 20 days would be suspended "for 6 months at which time,
unless the suspension is sooner vacated, the sentence to confinement at hard
labor for 20 days will be remitted without further action."</p>

<p>However, turning our attention down to Section 11, page 8, it was noted that
on June 27, 1958, which would be the time of his second court-martial, "Confinement
at hard labor for 28 days vacated on June 27, 1958."</p>

<p>So the way it is worded it says that the confinement would be vacated. Am
I correct in assuming, Colonel, that what it really means to say is that the
suspension of the sentence was vacated?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. This is correct.</p>

<p>However, there appears to be an error here, since the original sentence was
for 20 days, and not 28 days, as shown under the subject entry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Right.</p>

<p>So I suppose we have a typographical error, substituting 28 for 20 and we
also have a misleading sentence in that it implies that the sentence was vacated
rather than that the suspension of the sentence was vacated.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. This is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. However, Colonel, what did happen is that when he was court-martialed
the second time, they then sentenced him to both the sentence for
the second court-martial and at that time gave him the sentence that he received
in connection with the first court-martial?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Well, that portion of it&mdash;unexecuted portion of the first
sentence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. That is correct. Thank you.</p>

<p>On page 9 of the exhibit we have some records relating to the second court-martial.
At this point, again, I think the page is in general self-explanatory.
However, under the section marked "Findings" on each charge, and specifications,
there is the notation that on Charge II he was found not guilty, and
then it goes on to say, "On specification of" Charge I. Am I correct in thinking
that is a typographical error and that it should be that on the specification of
Charge II, he was found not guilty?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. So the record should read, on page 9, that Oswald was found guilty
on Charge I, which was a violation of Article 117 of the Uniform Code of Military
Justice. Similarly he was found guilty on the specification under Charge
I, which was wrongfully using provoking words to a staff noncommissioned
officer. However, on Charge II, which was a violation of Article 128 of the
Uniform Code of Military Justice, he was found not guilty, and he was similarly
found not guilty on the specification of that charge which was assaulting
a staff noncommissioned officer by pouring a drink on him.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. This is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Turning now to page 10 of the exhibit, the title of which is "Administrative
Remarks" I note entries dated April 14, 1958, indicating that a request
for an extension of Oswald's overseas tour had been received and approved.</p>

<p>Must such a request come from the marine whose overseas tour is involved?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Yes. This must be a voluntary request from the individual
concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. In other words, then, Oswald wanted to stay overseas longer than
he was scheduled to have been over there?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I note, also, on page 10 that this extension which had been approved
was later canceled, on July 13, 1958.</p>

<p>Is there any way of determining from this record what the reason for this
cancellation was?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. No; other than knowledge of the system, which indicates
that the local commander withdrew his approval of the extension as a result of
the disciplinary action.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. So we might guess that because this followed his second court-martial,
that was the reason?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Yes; and it followed it very closely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Now, we will move all the way over to page 26, and I want to ask
you about only one entry here&mdash;actually it is two entries relating to one event.</p>

<p>On January 19, 1959, the record discloses that Oswald departed El Toro for
Yuma, Arizona, and that on January 26, 1959, he returned to El Toro from Yuma.</p>

<p>Is there any way of telling from this record for what purpose he went to
Yuma?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Yes. The record shows that he departed MCS, MCAS, El
Toro, for ADEX, 1-59, which is a designation for an air defense exercise, the
first one held during 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Turning to page 27, I just want to clear up one detail that might be
confusing to somebody who has been in the Army rather than in the Marine Corps.</p>

<p>It is here noted that Oswald was, at least for part of his career, private, first
class, and at the same time his pay grade was "E-2". Am I correct in asserting
that in the Marine Corps a private is an E-1, a private first class is an E-2, your
E-3 is a lance corporal, and your E-4 is a corporal?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. This is correct. This is under the new rank structure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Turning now to page 36 of Folsom Deposition Exhibit 1, I want
to ask you about only one abbreviation here. This is one that is indicated for
both the periods June 27, 1958 through June 30, 1959 and July 1, 1958 through
July 24, 1958. It is an abbreviated CNF SSCM. What does that stand for?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Confined, serving sentence&mdash;it should be summary court-martial,
but let me look at the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You mean there should be three "S's"?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. I just want to be sure somebody didn't goof and ring a
special in here.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;serving sentence, summary court-martial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Turning now to page 106 of the exhibit, we have here a document
relating to the high school level general educational development tests which
were taken by Oswald on March 23, 1959. Page 106 reports the scores received
by Oswald on each of these five tests, and also converts each score into a so-called
United States percentile.</p>

<p>However, it does not make clear what the five areas in which Oswald was
tested were. Could you tell us what they are?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Yes. The high school "GED" test covers five areas. One,
English literature; two, English composition; three, social sciences; four,
physical sciences; five, mathematics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Is it the case that those five that you have just read off were read
in the same order as they are numbered on the score sheet?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Yes. The battery is administered in the sequence in which it
appears on the report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And am I correct in asserting that on this test Oswald received a
rating of satisfactory?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. This is correct. I believe USAFI rates as satisfactory or
unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Well, that is not entirely clear. We have a rating code printed in the lower
right-hand corner.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Well, they have two passing ones&mdash;satisfactory, and "D"
with distinction, and "U", unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. So he could have received a higher rating than he did?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. This is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Finally for this document, turning to page 120, we have a rather
imposing score sheet which relates Oswald's scores while he was in training
at Jacksonville, Florida. Could you explain the meaning of these numbers insofar
as you can?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Well, the first column indicates the number of hours devoted
to the subject. In the first instance, 37 hours to mathematics, two examinations
were given, he achieved a score of 67 on the first and 54 on the second.</p>

<p>The last&mdash;the next column indicates his average score for that subject.</p>

<p>Twenty-five hours physics, score, 75 and 77.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Excuse me. Do you know whether those scores you just read are
on a scale of 100?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. I do not know. But from the mathematics I would assume
they are, particularly since they say that 62 is a passing score.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Now, getting back again to the column which is second from the right, which
you say represents his average. It is his average on the previous test carried
out to three digits without the decimal point.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. That is correct. This report was prepared on an electric
accounting machine, and is a little difficult to interpret.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Yes. But I do see that that makes sense in terms of the individual
scores.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Do you want to go through all of these?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. No; I don't think that will be necessary, now that you have explained
the principle by which the scores are recorded.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Under the heading "Indoctrination Test Scores" this is a
test, an Army test battery, which in this instance was administered by the
Marine Corps at a Navy installation. It consists of a reading and vocabulary,
arithmetic computation, arithmetical reasoning, and pattern analysis. The
"GC" is an abbreviation for "GCT".</p>

<p>These are raw scores.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. The ones designated RV, AC, AR, and PA?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. And the scores indicated are raw scores, which converted to
the Marine Corps scoring on the general classification test shows that Oswald
achieved a score of 105 on this test battery, and a score of 106 on the Marine
Corps test batter. So the correlation is quite close.</p>

<p>The column headed "B" indicates year of birth. And the "G" column indicates
the number of years of schooling&mdash;in this case, nine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Colonel, I would finally like to show you a document which has already been
introduced in evidence before the Commission in connection with the testimony
of Marguerite Oswald. It is, therefore, designated Exhibit 239.</p>

<p>This exhibit is a photostatic copy.</p>

<p>Could you tell us, Colonel, of what it is a photostatic copy?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. It is a Photostatic copy of the U.S. Marine Corps Scorebook
for use with the U.S. Rifle, Caliber 30 M-1.</p>

<p>Now, this scorebook is issued to each individual at each time they are sent
on the rifle range for qualification or requalification.</p>

<p>They are maintained by the individual and are used to provide the individual
with a record of the idiosyncracies of the weapon, and the weather on the day
that the entries are made. This is referred to in the Marine Corps as the zero
of the rifle, because the sight settings are individual characteristics of the
particular rifle used. That is, he may&mdash;this rifle may require a half a point
more windage under the same wind velocity than another rifle, and that the
scale by yards may require adjustment depending upon the range that is being
fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. This book, then, is used by the individual Marine prior to his firing
for record in order that he can zero his weapon so that he will do well on his
record firing?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. This is the purpose. And it should be maintained even on
the day that he fires for record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
In this particular record, it would appear that the entries were rather limited.
As a matter of fact, it was not adequately maintained for the purpose
for which it was designed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Is it possible, Colonel, to tell anything from this scorebook, assuming
for the moment that it was accurately maintained, concerning the marksmanship
of Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Well, yes. But very generally. For instance, at 200 yards
slow fire&mdash;on Tuesday, at 200 yards slow fire, offhand <span class="locked">position&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You are referring, are you not, to the page designated 22 in Oswald's
scorebook?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Right&mdash;well, 22 as opposed to 23. He got out in the three
ring, which is not good. They should be able to keep them&mdash;all 10 shots within
the four ring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And even if his weapon needed a great deal of adjustment in terms
of elevation or windage, he still would have a closer group than that if he
were a good shot?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Yes. As a matter of fact, at 200 yards, people should get
a score of between 48 and 50 in the offhand position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And what was his score?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. Well, total shown on page 22 would be&mdash;he got a score of 34
out of a possible 50 on Tuesday, as shown on page 22 of his record book.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, he got a score of 38, improved four points.</p>

<p>Do you want to compute these?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I don't see any point in doing this page by page.</p>

<p>I just wonder, after having looked through the whole scorebook, if we could
fairly say that all that it proves is that at this stage of his career he was not
a particularly outstanding shot.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. No, no, he was not. His scorebook indicates&mdash;as a matter
of fact&mdash;that he did well at one or two ranges in order to achieve the two points
over the minimum score for sharpshooter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. In other words, he had a good day the day he fired for qualification?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. I would say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Well, Colonel, as far as I can see, that is all the testimony that we
need from you with regard to these records. No doubt there are ambiguities
in the records which I have not caught. I have asked you about the ones that
seemed most confusing to me.</p>

<p>Can you think of anything else that you would like to add for the record?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. No; I believe that the record is rather complete. There are
no missing documents from this official record. The photostatic copy contains
everything that is in the original record.</p>

<p>And I do not believe that there are any discrepancies, other than those clerical
errors which have been noted on such items as the summary court-martial
records.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. But you cannot think of any errors which we did not mention during
your testimony today?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Folsom</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. All right.</p>

<p>In that case, Colonel, on behalf of the Commission, I want to thank you very
much for giving your testimony. It has been very helpful.</p>

<h2 id="t311"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_CAPT_GEORGE_DONABEDIAN" id="TESTIMONY_OF_CAPT_GEORGE_DONABEDIAN">TESTIMONY OF CAPT. GEORGE DONABEDIAN</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Captain George Donabedian was taken at 2:15 p.m., on
May 1, 1964, at 200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C., by Mr. John Hart
Ely, member of the staff of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Will you stand and be sworn?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Please be seated.</p>

<p>My name is John Ely. I am a member of the legal staff of the President's
Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Staff members have been authorized to take the testimony of witnesses pursuant
to authority granted to the Commission by Executive Order No. 11130,
dated November 29, 1963, and joint Resolution of Congress No. 137.</p>

<p>Under the Commission's rules, each witness is to be provided with a copy of
the Executive order of the joint resolution, and a copy of the rules that the
Commission has adopted governing the taking of testimony from witnesses.</p>

<p>Is it correct that I have provided you with copies of these documents?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Under the Commission rules, also, each witness is entitled to 3 days'
notice before he is required to come and give testimony.</p>

<p>You were not given 3 days' notice.</p>

<p>However, each witness can waive that notice requirement if he wishes, and
I assume by your presence that you are willing to waive that notice requirement.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would you state your full name, please?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. Captain George Donabedian, Medical Corps, U.S. Navy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And what position exactly do you hold?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. Staff medical officer, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps,
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You are an M.D., is that correct?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. How long have you held the position of staff medical officer?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. Since July 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Prior to the assassination of President Kennedy, had you ever heard
of Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. No; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You, like Lieutenant Colonel Folsom, were called in to give us
some help in interpreting the records of Lee Harvey Oswald&mdash;in other words,
your testimony does not stem from any personal contact with the man.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I will show you now a document which I have just labeled "Donabedian
Deposition Exhibit No. 1."</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked "Donabedian Deposition Exhibit
No. 1" for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Doctor, could you tell us generally what this document is?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. This is taken from the health record of the marine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. It is, in other words, a photostatic <span class="locked">copy&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. A photostatic copy of a medical document which each
military person has. We have the physical examinations on entrance, and
any other illnesses that he may develop during his service, which diseases
are recorded and the treatments are recorded, and the inoculations he receives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I have numbered the pages of this exhibit in the upper right-hand
corner. Because it was previously part of a larger document, Commission
Document 82, the pagination of Donabedian Deposition Exhibit No. 1 runs from
132 through 171.</p>

<p>Doctor, I would like, first, to refer you to an entry made on page 147 of this
exhibit, and dated July 12, 1958.</p>

<p>Could you explain it?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. "Bleeding from the rectum. For the past 1 month
has noticed bleeding on paper after bowel movement. This a.m., one to two
drops bright red blood dropped into stool. Bowel movement light brown and
very hard. Examination."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. The copy at that point becomes illegible.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. "Slight irritation and moderate." Anyway, they gave
him treatment with mineral oil.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And what was the overall diagnosis?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. Hemorrhoids was the diagnosis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And what did you say the treatment was?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. The treatment was mineral oil, rectal suppository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. All right. I would like to show you now an entry which is on page
40, but which is chronologically later than the one to which we just referred,
and that is the entry <span class="locked">dated&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. 10-6-57. "Urethritis acute. Nonvenereal."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Before we get into that, could we discuss the entry of 10-10-58?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. "Sigmoidoscopy." I don't know what this number is,
unless the number of the procedure. They discharged this man on 10-13-58.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you believe that relates to the hemorrhoids?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. He may have had some trouble with the lower bowel,
or possibly some more bleeding, and they looked inside the rectum and the
sigmoid to determine if there was any cause of the bleeding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I would like at this point to refer you to pages 152 through 156 of
this exhibit.</p>

<p>I shall let you proceed to explain what these mean without questioning.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. On 9-10-58, slight burning on urination. "Has urethral
discharge."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Well, if you cannot read it, there is no <span class="locked">point&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. Then they took a smear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. What is the purpose of a smear?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. A smear is to diagnose the cause of the infection, the
cause of the discharge, to see what type of bacteria was present.</p>

<p>And on 9-23-58, report of a urethral discharge sensitivity test. A culture
was taken and reported staphylococcal hemolytic. And the sensitivity test to
determine what drug we have that will affect that particular bacteria that is
causing this. And erythromycin was the drug of choice.</p>

<p>On page 154, on 16 September 58 he evidently went to one of the outlying
dispensaries, and they said "Send to the mainside for smear," which means
he was sent to the mainside dispensary to get the smear taken.</p>

<p>September 1958, the complaint was urethral discharge. They sent him to
the lab for a smear.</p>

<p>And here it says, "Gram negative, diplococci intra- and extra-cellular morphological
resembling neisseria gonococci."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Could you tell us, Doctor, generally, what that means?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. Well, this resembles the gonococcus bacteria which
causes gonorrhea. And it says here morphologically resembling this germ&mdash;since
the only legal diagnosis would be to have a culture made to prove this or
disprove it.</p>

<p>And here for his treatment they gave him penicillin, it looks like 400,000
units, four times a day, for 3 days, and said "Return on Monday in the p.m.,
for a repeat smear."</p>

<p>Then on September 30, 1958, "Still has profuse discharge, somewhat clearer,
received course of penicillin ending 2 days ago."</p>

<p>In other words, he had finished getting his penicillin. So for this profuse
discharge, they treated him with chloromycetin capsules, one, four times a
day, and return Monday for smear and culture.</p>

<p>Then on September <span class="locked">22&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I believe the last item was September 20.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. Then September 22, 1958, urethral discharge, and it
says "September 23" underneath&mdash;"urethral discharge, smear and culture."</p>

<p>The smear showed many pus cells, no organisms noted. The culture showed
micrococcus pyogenous vas aurens. This is the type of bacteria that gives a
dark-greenish color discharge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Does either the results of the smear or the results of the culture
say anything about whether or not Oswald had gonorrhea, or can we tell?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. Not in this one.</p>

<p>The one above here, we assume he had gonorrhea&mdash;on the 16th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. We would assume he had it, even though, as you pointed out, you
could not prove it in court, because it was determined by a smear rather than
a culture?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. Most of the doctors use this. They may take a smear,
and they find that&mdash;intra and extracellular diplococci, they treat the patient
for gonorrhea.</p>

<p>Now, the treatment for his micrococcus pyogenous is "continue chloromycetin,"
I guess it is four times a day. Yes; it was four times a day. And then
continue four times a day. And something was given. And they wanted him
to return again. I cannot tell what this is. Instructions, probably. Some
instructions were given.</p>

<p>On September 29, 1958, the complaint was urethral discharge. They took a
smear. And that was&mdash;"many pus cells were noted, no organisms were noted."</p>

<p>The note underneath is "good response to therapy, has been doing much heavy
lifting." They must have given him light duty for 3 days. "To repeat
smear, 1 week."</p>

<p>October 6, 1958, the complaint was urethral discharge. They took a smear.
The report was "moderate amount of pus cells, few gram positive cocci."</p>

<p>This is not gonorrhea. "Heavy discharge with occasional burning. Has been
doing heavy lifting recently."</p>

<p>"Some heavy discharge with occasional burning of the urination"&mdash;although
this says dysurea&mdash;"has been doing heavy lifting recently."</p>

<p>October 24, 1958, the complaint was urethral discharge, and they gave him
pyridium, one tablet five times a day&mdash;one gram five times a day.</p>

<p>No&mdash;"return in 5 days."</p>

<p>They just gave him pyridium, and "d" means to duty, and return in 5 days.</p>

<p>"Smear, few pus cells, some mucus threads noted, occasional gram positive
cocci noted."</p>

<p>The next date is hard to tell. Something&mdash;"qid for for 5 days."</p>

<p>The next thing is hard to tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. All right. That entry is illegible.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. Page 156. He was admitted to the sick list, 9-16-58,
diagnosis, "urethritis acute due to gonococcus." This is No. 0303. And in <span class="locked">handwriting&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. That is my handwriting, so we will disregard that.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. The chief complaint is urethral discharge. "Present
illness. Patient complains of a slight discharge and a stinging sensation on
urination. Past history&mdash;previous venereal disease. Physical examination, essentially
negative, except for thick mucco burn discharge from the urethra.
Laboratory. Smear reveals gram negative intra- and extra-cellular diplococci
having a morphology resembling gonorrhea."</p>

<p>Unless they took a culture to grow the germ out, they could not absolutely be
certain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You mentioned that under this previous history column it mentioned
"previous VD." Does that mean that Oswald had had it prior to this time?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. At another time, in his past, whenever that would be.
It could have been while he was in the service, although we didn't notice in
these records. But he could have had it before he came in the service. VD could
be any venereal disease. There are five different kinds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. But you have not seen any reference in his medical records to any
prior case during his military career?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. No; except those that we reported within those dates.</p>

<p>Treatment was procaine penicillin, 900,000 units, intramuscularly for 3 days.</p>

<p>Now, you remember when we read the other report it looked like 400,000 units.
It is most apt to be 900,000 units.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. It should be noted page 156 contains typewriting rather than handwriting
as the other one did. And I believe this entry on page 156 is something
of a summary.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. This is a summary. He was admitted on 9-16-58, and
discharged on the same day. But they readmitted these VD cases for statistical
purposes, so we can keep track of how many people have been in contact with
this. And he was sent to duty under treatment and observation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would it be fair to say, Doctor, summarizing your testimony as to
these few pages, that this looks, as far as we can tell, like a typical case of
gonorrhea?</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. Yes; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Nothing extraordinary about it? But it certainly does seem that
he did have gonorrhea at this point?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. These medical records also contain entries relating to the gunshot
wound received by Oswald in connection with the .22-caliber pistol he had stored
in his footlocker. I believe those entries are self-explanatory. Also, in filling out
his own forms on physicals, Oswald made reference to a mastoid operation which
he had had when he was a child. This, also, I think, is something we don't
have to go into at this point.</p>

<p>Doctor, I will ask you, in conclusion, if you, in looking through his medical
records, have noticed anything which we have not mentioned which seems to you
extraordinary&mdash;anything over and above the normal marine's complaints.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. No; not offhand. He had a sore throat, which many
boys have in the service. He had a cold. And he had one other infection,
otitis media, in 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. That reference appears at page 150.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. And they give him penicillin, 600,000 units, 5 days.</p>

<p>I see nothing else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. In that case, Doctor, we will thank you very much for helping to
explain these records for us.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Donabedian</span>. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="t315"><a name="AFFIDAVIT_OF_JAMES_ANTHONY_BOTELHO" id="AFFIDAVIT_OF_JAMES_ANTHONY_BOTELHO">AFFIDAVIT OF JAMES ANTHONY BOTELHO</a></h2>

<p>The following affidavit was executed by James Anthony Botelho on June 3,
1964.</p>

<p class="p2 right">
AFFIDAVIT</p>

<p class="in0">PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION<br />
ON THE ASSASSINATION OF<br />
PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY</p>
<p class="in0">
<span class="smcap">State of California</span>,<br />
<i>County of San Benito, ss</i>:<br />
</p>

<p>I, James Anthony Botelho, 820 West Alisal Street, Salinas, California, being
first duly sworn, depose and say:</p>

<p>That I served in the United States Marine Corps from January 8, 1957, to
January 8, 1960. I served with Lee Harvey Oswald from about March to
September 1959, while we were both attached to Marine Air Control Squadron
No. 9, Marine Corps Air Facility, Santa Ana, California.</p>

<p>Oswald once mentioned to me that he would like to go to Cuba to train
Castro's troops because of the money he would earn.</p>

<p>I shared a room with Oswald for approximately two months prior to his
discharge. He was unusual in that he generally would not speak unless spoken
to, and his answers were always brief. He seldom associated with others.</p>

<p>Oswald subscribed to a newspaper printed in Russian, which I believe he
said was published in San Francisco. It was common knowledge that Oswald
had taught himself to speak Russian. Oswald used expressions like "da" and
"niet" around the squadron. Some of his fellow Marines kidded him by calling
him "Oswaldskovich". Once, when I called him up "Oswald", he requested in a
serious vein, that I refer to him as "Oswaldskovich". At times Oswald referred,
seemingly seriously, to "American capitalist warmongers."</p>

<p>At times I discussed Communism and Russia with Oswald. My impression
is that although he believed in pure Marxist theory, he did not believe in the
way Communism was practiced by the Russians. I was quite surprised when I
learned that Oswald had gone to Russia.</p>

<p>Generally, Oswald's uniforms were clean but not neat; they were either
unironed or sloppily ironed.</p>

<p>As far I know, Oswald seldom left the post. On one occasion he and I went
to a movie in Santa Ana; on other occasions we walked around Santa Ana.</p>

<p>Although Oswald did a good deal of reading, I do not remember what sort
of books he read. We both enjoyed classical music. I still have some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
classical records we purchased together. I recall that he particularly enjoyed
Tchaikovsky's "Russian War Dance". Oswald played chess with both me and
Call. Oswald was not a very good chess player, although he was better than
I was.</p>

<p>It was my impression that Oswald was quite intelligent. He performed
his job no better and no worse than the average Marine; he made no effort to
obtain perfection. His superiors had to "keep after him" in order to get him to
finish the job he had been assigned. This surveillance made him all the more
belligerent. In my opinion, one was likely to get better results from him by
treating him politely.</p>

<p>I do not recall Oswald's engaging in any fights, except for nonbelligerent
recreation around the barracks.</p>

<p>It is my impression that Oswald's clearance was taken away from him; for
this reason, I believe he was made company clerk at Santa Ana. I believe that
before Oswald requested his hardship discharge, the Sergeant Major was planning
to take steps to "straighten Oswald out."</p>

<p>Although Oswald may have drunk at times, I never observed him to be
intoxicated.</p>

<p>I do not remember Oswald's studying Spanish or German nor do I recall
any remarks concerning his religious beliefs.</p>

<p>I remember Oswald's having a date with a girl who spoke Russian. I believe
Oswald liked the girl a great deal, but he was for some reason unable to get in
touch with her thereafter. I have no recollection of his receiving any visitors.</p>

</p>

<p>I, Donald Peter Camarata, 601 Burlingame Avenue, Capitola, California, being
first duly sworn, depose and say:</p>

<p>That Lee Harvey Oswald and I were concurrently stationed at the following
military installations while we were both members of the United States Marine
Corps: Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi; the Marine Air Stations
at El Toro and Santa Ana, California, and possibly the Naval Air Station at
Jacksonville, Florida. Although I served in the Far East, Oswald and I were
not in the same unit at that time.</p>

<p>While in the Marine Corps, I heard from other Marines that Oswald was studying
Russian. I personally observed that Oswald had his name written in
Russian on one of his jackets, and played records of Russian songs so loud that
one could hear them outside the barracks.</p>

<p>Either en route back to the United States or subsequent to my return, I heard
a rumor to the effect that Oswald had been in some way responsible for the
death of Martin Schrand. I have no personal knowledge of any such involvement.
I do not remember who told me of this rumor, and am not even certain
that I heard it from more than one person.</p>

<p>Oswald seldom, if ever, left the post in the company of other Marines. I
would not characterize Oswald as an extremely unfriendly person; he simply
did not often choose to be with his fellow Marines off post.</p>

<p>Oswald was not particularly prone to fighting. Although he apparently resented
the orders of his superiors no more than does the average Marine, he
was more outspoken than average in his resentment. However, he generally
followed such orders.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
Although I have no firm impression of the level of Oswald's intelligence, he
was a man who attempted to make other people believe he was intelligent.</p>

<p>I know from rumor that Oswald received a newspaper printed in Russian.
I was informed by my fellow Marines that one of his superiors&mdash;either the
First Sergeant or a Lieutenant&mdash;asked Oswald why he read this paper.</p>

<p>I have no recollection of Oswald's studying or speaking either Spanish or
German: of any remarks on his part concerning Communism, Russia, or Cuba:
of his religious beliefs: of any abnormal attitude toward women on his part; or
of his receiving any visitors.</p>

<p>Oswald was nicknamed "Oz".</p>

<p>I, Peter Francis Connor, 27 Flaum Drive, West Haven, Connecticut, being
first duly sworn, depose and say:</p>

<p>That, while I was in the Marine Corps, I was stationed at Atsugi, Japan,
with Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Oswald had the reputation of being a good worker. I observed that he was not
personally neat. I remember that while Oswald was in Japan, he wore an
expert rifleman's medal.</p>

<p>I never heard Oswald make any anti-American or pro-Communist statements.
He claimed to be named after Robert E. Lee, whom he characterized as the
greatest man in history.</p>

<p>Although Oswald engaged in several fights&mdash;one of them with a Robert
Demurs&mdash;I have no recollection as to how good a fighter he was.</p>

<p>Oswald did not choose to associate with his fellow Marines, nor did they
choose to associate with him. He often responded to the orders of his superiors
with insolent remarks.</p>

<p>I have no recollection to how much Oswald drank.</p>

<p>I was of the opinion that Oswald was intelligent. He read a great deal, but
I do not remember what sort of books he read.</p>

<p>Oswald was nicknamed "Harv." This was a shortened version of his middle
name; for some reason it upset him to be called by it.</p>

<p>I have no recollection concerning Oswald's religious beliefs, his attitude
toward women, or what he did off post.</p>

<p>That I served in the United States Marine Corps from 1948 to 1961. While
stationed in California, I was Lee Harvey Oswald's Platoon Sergeant.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
Oswald often complained about the Marine Corps; he seemed to me to resent
all military authority. He also seemed narrow-minded, refusing to listen to
the views of others.</p>

<p>Once, at the rifle range, I had a long discussion with Oswald concerning why
he found it difficult to adapt to the Marine Corps. He explained that his mother
had had a great deal of trouble during the depression and that when he was
young, he had often not had enough to eat. He felt that he had been forced
to accept responsibility at a premature age. He remarked that he was tired
of being "kicked around."</p>

<p>Oswald never gave to me any indication of favoring Communism or opposing
capitalism.</p>

<p>It was difficult to judge the level of Oswald's intelligence, because he seldom
stated his opinions. However, with regard to his job in the Marine Corps,
Oswald learned quickly.</p>

<p>Oswald went to a great many movies, and did not often engage in sports.</p>

<p>It is my recollection that Oswald enjoyed firing a rifle, and scored in the
"high expert" range.</p>

<p>Oswald did not drink excessively, and kept his temper&mdash;if indeed he had a
temper&mdash;in check.</p>

<p>I have no recollection of Oswald's studying foreign languages; of where he
went when he had time off; of his reading habits or religious beliefs; or of any
nicknames for him. Nor do I remember his having any dates.</p>

<p>I, John Rene Heindel, 812 Belleville Street, New Orleans, Louisiana, being

<p>That I served in the United States Marine Corps from July 15, 1957, until
July 15, 1961. I was stationed at Atsugi, Japan, with Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>I recall that Oswald was often in trouble for failure to adhere to rules and
regulations and gave the impression of disliking any kind of authority.</p>

<p>While in the Marine Corps, I was often referred to as "Hidell"&mdash;pronounced
so as to rhyme with "Rydell" rather than "Fidel." This was a nickname and
not merely an inadvertent mispronounciation. It is possible that Oswald might
have heard me being called by this name; indeed he may himself have called
me "Hidell." However, I have no specific recollection of his either using or
hearing this name.</p>

<p>Although I generally regarded Oswald as an intelligent person, I did not
observe him to be particularly interested in politics or international affairs.</p>

<p>While in Japan, Oswald drank a good deal, at times becoming intoxicated.
He was willing to do so because he did not greatly care whether or not he got
back to the post on time.</p>

<p>Oswald did not often talk back to his superiors, but was likely to complain
about their orders when he was alone with his fellow Marines.</p>

<p>Oswald generally went on liberty by himself; I therefore do not know what
his activities off post were.</p>

<p>I do not recall Oswald's being called by any nicknames.</p>

<p>Although our Marine Air Group was sent to Formosa for a period of time, I
am unable to remember Oswald's being there.</p>

</p>

<p>I, David Christie Murray, Jr., 1419 Pinewood Road North, Jacksonville Beach,
Florida, being first duly sworn, depose and say:</p>

<p>That I served in the United States Marine Corps from approximately October,
1956, to October, 1959. I served with Lee Harvey Oswald in MACS-9
at the Lighter Than Air Station at Santa Anna, California. Part of the time
I was stationed at Santa Anna, I was married and therefore during that time
lived off the base. While at Santa Anna, I served also with a Marine named
Nelson Delgado, whom I had previously known while I was stationed at Parris
Island, South Carolina. My impression is that at this time Delgado was an
immature person with few original thoughts.</p>

<p>Oswald did not often associate with his fellow Marines. Although I know of no
general explanation for this, I personally stayed away from Oswald because I had
heard a rumor to the effect that he was homosexual. I personally observed nothing
to support this rumor, and am not sure that I heard it from more than one
person. Oswald seldom, if ever, went out with women; this may have been one
of the reasons I came to the conclusion that he might have been homosexual.</p>

<p>Oswald complained about orders given him more than the average Marine
did. He was a person who was never satisfied with any event or situation. He
was quietly sarcastic. Though he tried to be witty, in my opinion his attempts
at humor failed. However, he&mdash;unlike Delgado&mdash;was not a show-off; he did not
seem to want to be the center of attention.</p>

<p>I regarded Oswald as quite intelligent, and, prior to the assassination of
President Kennedy, was of the opinion that he had received a college education.
I am under the impression that he told me that he was a college graduate, but I
may have come to this conclusion because he once spoke to me of going to Officer
Candidate School.</p>

<p>Oswald was not personally neat, but he performed his job well. When I knew
him, he was studying Russian. He often made remarks in Russian; the less
intelligent members of the unit admired him for this.</p>

<p>I do not recall Oswald's making any remarks on the subject of religion. Nor
do I recall his drinking. Although I do not remember his getting into any fights,
he had a "chip on the shoulder" personality which would be likely to involve him
in fights. I do not remember his studying either Spanish or German.</p>

<p>Although I recall that Oswald read a great deal, I do not remember what
sort of books he read. He played chess a good deal, particularly with Richard
Call. I have no recollection of his enjoying music. Nor do I remember his
making any trips off post, or his subscribing to a Russian newspaper.</p>

<p>Most of his fellow Marines called Oswald "Lee." I do not remember his
being called "Oz".</p>

<p>I, Paul Edward Murphy, 1706 South Evergreen Street, Apartment C, Santa
Ana, California, being first duly sworn, depose and say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
That I served in the United States Marine Corps from June, 1956, to September,
1959. I was stationed at Atsugi, Japan, and thereafter at Santa Ana, California,
with Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>The unit which was stationed at Atsugi spent four to six weeks in Okinawa
late in 1957. It also spent some time in the Philippines, where it was at times
at bases at Subic Bay and Cubi Point. Another trip took it to Corregidor.</p>

<p>Oswald was self-contained and withdrawn. He complained about orders he
had received from superiors, but followed them.</p>

<p>Although Oswald did not normally expound to me his political or ideological
views, I am of the opinion that he was generally in sympathy with Castro.</p>

<p>One night in the barracks in Japan, I heard a shot in an adjoining cubicle.
I rushed into the cubicle to find Oswald sitting on a foot locker looking at a
wound in his arm. When I asked what had happened, Oswald very unemotionally
replied, "I believe I shot myself". Oswald was at that time in possession
of a small calibre pistol which he was not authorized to possess.</p>

<p>While at Santa Ana, Oswald had a subscription to a newspaper printed in
English which I believe was titled either "The Worker" or "The Socialist
Worker." Members of the unit saw copies of this paper as they passed through
the mailroom; when the paper was identified as being directed to Oswald, few
were surprised. I do not recall Oswald's receiving other literature of a Socialist
nature.</p>

<p>I remember that Oswald could speak a little Russian, even when he was overseas.
I have no recollection of his studying either Spanish or German.</p>

<p>Oswald was proficient at his assigned job, but he was below average in the
areas of discipline and military courtesy. He was, however, personally quite
neat.</p>

<p>Although Oswald drank, he did not drink excessively. His temperament was
such that he would push companions to the verge of fighting him, but seldom, if
ever, actually took the step of engaging in a fight.</p>

<p>It is my opinion that Oswald was of average intelligence. He read a great
deal at the library at Atsugi. I do not recall what sort of books he read. He
also went to the movies a great deal. I have no specific recollection of his appreciation
of classical music, although I remember that Oswald&mdash;like everyone
else&mdash;watched Dick Clark's American Bandstand on television. Oswald also
played chess.</p>

<p>I have no recollection concerning Oswald's religious beliefs.</p>

<p>I can recall Oswald having no dates while stationed at Santa Ana. While
overseas, however, Oswald had an active social life as most other Marines.
Oswald seldom left the post at Santa Ana; I do not know where he went on those
occasions when he did leave.</p>

<p>Oswald was nicknamed "Harvey" after "Harvey the Rabbit", a movie which
was then circulating. So far as I know, Oswald acquired this nickname for no
reason other than that it was his middle name.</p>

<p>I do not recall Oswald's receiving any visitors.</p>

<p>That while in the United States Marine Corps I served for approximately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
three or four months with Lee Harvey Oswald in MACS-9 in Santa Ana,
California.</p>

<p>On one occasion I arranged a date for Oswald with my aunt, Rosaleen Quinn,
an airline stewardess who, because she was interested in working for the American
Embassy in Russia, had taken a leave from her job in order to study Russian.
I arranged the date because I knew of Oswald's study of the Russian language.
I also arranged a date for my aunt with Lieutenant John E. Donovan. I am
under the impression that prior to studying Russian, Oswald had studied
German.</p>

<p>I recall no serious political remarks on the part of Oswald. On occasion, however,
Oswald, when addressing other Marines, would refer to them as "Comrade."
It seemed to me&mdash;and, as far as I know, to my fellow Marines&mdash;that Oswald
used this term in fun. At times some of us responded by calling <i>him</i> "Comrade."
Oswald also enjoyed listening to recordings of Russian songs.</p>

<p>My recollection of Oswald is to the effect that he was personally quite neat,
and that he stayed to himself. Oswald complained about orders that he was
given, but no more than did the average Marine. I regarded Oswald as quite
intelligent, in view of the fact that he had taught himself two foreign languages.
I do not recall Oswald's having any dates other than the one which I arranged
for him with my aunt.</p>

<p>I do not remember Oswald's getting into any fights. I have no recollection
concerning Oswald's reading habits, religious beliefs, or trips off the post. I do
not remember his reading a Russian newspaper, and do not recall his having any
nicknames. (I was nicknamed "Beezer.") I do not remember Oswald's having
his name written in Russian on his jacket, and have no recollection of any visitors

</p>

<p>I, Mack Osborne, 2816 43rd Street, Lubbock, Texas, being first duly sworn,
depose and say:</p>

<p>That while I was in the United States Marine Corps, I served in Marine Air
Control Squadron 9 in Santa Ana, California, with Lee Harvey Oswald. Prior
to his discharge, I shared a room with him.</p>

<p>Oswald was at that time studying Russian. He spent a great deal of his free
time reading papers printed in Russian&mdash;which I believe he bought in Los
Angeles&mdash;with the aid of a Russian-English dictionary. I believe he also had
some books written in Russian, although I do not remember their names.</p>

<p>I once asked Oswald why he did not go out in the evening like the other men.
He replied that he was saving his money, making some statement to the effect
that one day he would do something which would make him famous. In
retrospect, it is my belief&mdash;although he said nothing to this effect&mdash;that he had
his trip to Russia in mind when he made this statement.</p>

<p>Although Oswald did not directly talk back to his superiors, he did the tasks
assigned him poorly and complained about them to his fellow Marines.</p>

<p>My recollection is that Oswald was a radar operator of average ability.
Although he was personally clean, he scored quite poorly on barracks inspections.</p>

<p>Although Oswald was not openly hostile to his fellow Marines, when they
asked him to participate in their activities, he would refuse, stating that he had
something else to do. He thereby encouraged others to leave him alone.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
Oswald drank only in clubs located on the post. He explained to me that
he did not drink off the post because while stationed in Japan, he had been
court-martialed for hitting a sergeant with a beer bottle. I do not recall his having
any fights while at Santa Ana. However, I remember Oswald's telling me of
a fight with a brig guard, as well as of the fight with the sergeant, in Japan.</p>

<p>I do not recall Oswald's studying either Spanish or German. I do not recall
any remarks on his part concerning Communism, Russia, or Cuba. Because of
the fact that he was studying Russian, fellow Marines sometimes jokingly
accused him of being a Russian spy. In my opinion he took such accusations
in fun.</p>

<p>Although I did not regard Oswald as particularly intelligent, I got the idea
that he thought he was intelligent and tried verbally to suggest to others that
he was.</p>

<p>Oswald read a great deal, although I do not remember what sort of books
he read. He also watched television and played chess. I have no recollection
of any interest in music on his part. Although he would discuss religion with
others, he was noncommital as to his own opinions.</p>

<p>Oswald seldom, if ever, went out with women. I suspect that this was part
of his program on saving money. He seldom left the post, although sometimes
when I returned from weekends, he would tell me that he had been to Los
Angeles&mdash;implying that he had simply gone to break the monotony.</p>

<p>I do not recall Oswald's having any nicknames. He was simply called
"Oswald" or&mdash;by those who knew him well&mdash;"Lee Harvey".</p>

<p>I have no recollection of Oswald's receiving any visitors.</p>

December, 1959. From December, 1958, to December, 1959, I was stationed
with Marine Air Control Squadron #9, Lighter Than Air Station, Santa Ana,

I lived in the ensign hut next to, and was on the same radar crew as, Oswald.
I estimate that I talked to some extent with Oswald each day during the period
that we were stationed together.</p>

<p>It was very difficult to evaluate Oswald's personality because he never talked
about his life prior to joining the Marine Corps or about what he did while in
the Marine Corps. Although by the usual standards I was just an acquaintance
of Oswald, I probably was one of his best friends.</p>

<p>Oswald once dated an airline stewardess who was learning Russian.</p>

<p>Oswald spent a great deal of time reading. I do not remember what he read,
because he never talked about it. He also spent a great deal of time playing
chess. I played chess with him about once a week; we were of approximately
equal ability.</p>

<p>Although members of the unit often had discussions on foreign affairs, Oswald
seldom, if ever, participated.</p>

<p>During this time, Oswald was studying Russian. For this reason many members
of the unit kidded him about being a Russian spy; Oswald seemed to enjoy
this sort of remark. At that time I had a phonograph record of Russian classical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
pieces entitled "Russian Fireworks." When I would play this record, Oswald
would come over to me and say "You called?" I had a chess set which contained
red and white chessmen; Oswald always chose the red chessmen, making some
remark to the effect that he preferred the "Red Army." In connection with
this general joking about Oswald's interest in Russian, he was nicknamed
"Oswaldskovich." However, I do not recall Oswald's making serious remarks
with regard to the Soviet Union or Cuba.</p>

<p>On one occasion, Oswald remarked to me that he had been awarded a scholarship
to Albert Schweitzer University and that he planned to attend, remarking
that they taught English at Schweitzer.</p>

<p>I believe Oswald generally remained on the post; I do not remember anyone's
going on liberty with him. Sometimes he and I went to the base movie theatre.</p>

<p>Oswald was not enthusiastic about his job, and performed about as well
as the average radar operator.</p>

<p>Although I sometimes observed Oswald drinking in the Enlisted Men's Club,
I do not remember his ever becoming intoxicated.</p>

<p>Oswald complained about the orders he was given, but no more than did the
average Marine. However, it was my opinion that the Staff Non-Commissioned
Officers did not think of Oswald as capable. In my opinion, this attitude was
a result of the fact that Oswald did not try to hide his lack of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I have no recollection of Oswald's studying either Spanish or German.</p>

<p>It was difficult to tell how intelligent Oswald was, because of his refusal to
communicate. It was clear, however, that Oswald <i>wanted</i> to be thought of
as intelligent.</p>

<p>Nelson Delgado was at this time devoutly religious. Another Marine from
California, who at that time was interested in Zen Buddhism, had an idol of
Buddha solely for the purpose of making Delgado angry. He succeeded in this
attempt. Oswald enjoyed this successful attempt to anger Delgado.</p>

<p>Oswald's reactions to everything were subdued and Stoic.</p>

<p>Oswald's hardship discharge came as a surprise to the members of the unit;
we had not known of it long in advance. I have no recollection of Oswald's
receiving any visitors.</p>

<h2 id="t324"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_MARTIN_ISAACS" id="TESTIMONY_OF_MARTIN_ISAACS">TESTIMONY OF MARTIN ISAACS</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Martin Isaacs was taken on April 16, 1964, at the U.S.
courthouse, Foley Square, New York, N.Y. by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Martin Isaacs, having been first duly sworn, was examined and testified as
follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am an attorney on the legal
staff of the President's Commission investigating the assassination of President
Kennedy. Staff members have been authorized to take the testimony of witnesses
by the Commission pursuant to authority granted to the Commission by
Executive Order No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution of
Congress No. 137.</p>

<p>The Commission has also established rules of procedure governing the taking
of testimony from witnesses, and under those rules of procedure each witness
is to be furnished with a copy of the Executive order and joint resolution to
which I referred, as well as with a copy of the rules governing the taking of
testimony.</p>

<p>The Commission will provide you with a set of those documents.</p>

<p>Under the rules governing the taking of testimony, each witness is entitled
to 3 days' notice before he is required to appear and give testimony. I don't
know whether you actually received 3 days' notice or not, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. They told me yesterday about it. It's quite all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Each witness is able to waive that notice, and I presume that
you do wish to waive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I waive, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>We want to inquire briefly of you today concerning any contacts which you
or your office may have had with Lee Harvey Oswald and his family upon
Oswald's return from Russia in approximately June of 1962.</p>

<p>Before we get into the details of that testimony, however, would you state your
full name for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Martin Isaacs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where do you live, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. 1669 Grand Avenue, Bronx, New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where are you employed at the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I am employed by the Special Services Welfare Center, Department
of Welfare, City of New York, 42 Franklin Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you so employed in June of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When and where were you born, Mr. Isaacs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I was born in Hungary, December 12, 1904.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you come to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I was about 2 or 3 years old. I don't recall exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you presently a citizen of this country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I am a citizen, yes; derivative citizenship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your parents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. My father became a citizen, and, of course, I received derivative
citizenship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long have you employed by the department of welfare?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Since May 12, 1934.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And this is the Department of Welfare of the City of New York;
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recall personally coming into contact with Lee Harvey
Oswald and his family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I do recall coming into personal contact; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you give us the best recollection that you have concerning
that event?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I was told by our intake, I believe it was, that the family was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
the Welfare Center. If I recollect correctly, I think the Travelers Aid Society
sent them here. I am not positive about this.</p>

<p>My worker, Mr. Lehrman, as I remember, was not available at the time to go
in and see the family. I believe he was in the field at the time. He is a social
investigator in the Department of Welfare. I went in to ascertain whether I
could expedite getting the information that would be needed to help this family
return to Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You had been informed at that time that they desired to return
to Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Yes; the intake worker, I can't remember who it was at the
moment&mdash;I am sorry, I don't remember the name of the worker who handled
the family inside of our intake&mdash;told us that this family was in the office, and
I think we obtained sufficient information at the time to make a clearance to
determine whether the family is actually a repatriated family.</p>

<p>In many instances people come to us and tell us that they were repatriated
when in effect they weren't. They are, in other words, sent here incorrectly to
our office. When we clear, we find out that they are not repatriates, and so they
must be handled in a different manner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you say "repatriates," what do you mean, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. A repatriate is one who is a United States citizen, who was living
abroad and finds himself, either because of economic circumstances or because
of ill health unable to maintain himself there, and so they go&mdash;either they go
directly to our Embassy in the country in which they reside or they are directed
to go there or the Embassy learns about this from the government in which they
live, and so they are helped to return to the United States. In some instances
they ask to be returned. In other instances they are ordered to be returned.
For example, if the person is mentally ill. In this case we did clear, and we
ascertained that they were repatriates, and so the role that I played in this as
I remember&mdash;using my memory <span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let me ask you this, if I may, Mr. Isaacs, before you go into
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember how you determined that the Oswald family
was a repatriated family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Yes. This is the way it was done: We get the information from
the family. In this instance I think it was done by the intake worker. He got
certain facts. I assume that Mr. Oswald gave them all these facts, that he
went to Russia in a certain period of his life, and what happened there, and
then when he returned and why he returned.</p>

<p>When we get all this data, we present that to our administrator, Mrs. Ruscoll,
and she contacts the New York State Department of Social Welfare, who is the
immediate representative, to determine these facts. The person that she would
call is a Miss Elliott, Miss Lula Jean Elliott.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She is with the New York State <span class="locked">Department&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. The Department of Social Welfare. Then Miss Elliott called the
U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and, of course, we understand
that this is the means they used to get the information, and they call
Washington, and when they have this information it is relayed back in the
same way. And then the administrator tells us, yes, he is a repatriate. And
in this instance, this is what actually happened, as I remember it. We were
told that they were.</p>

<p>Now, we have a policy of calling whatever relatives are available to determine
whether relatives could meet the cost of their return. In this instance he
asked to be returned to Texas, and we did get enough information in our application
blank to show that there was a brother&mdash;I believe it was Robert&mdash;who
lived in Texas, and I made a telephone call to the brother. The brother
was not in, and I spoke with his wife&mdash;I don't remember her first name&mdash;and
I told her that Mr. Oswald was here with his wife and infant, and they wanted
to return to Texas, and would they be able to raise sufficient funds to meet this
cost. She was very happy, apparently, to learn that they had arrived already&mdash;evidently
they had some advance notice&mdash;and she immediately said she will call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
her husband and make arrangements to send this money&mdash;I don't remember
the amount that was involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was Oswald present at the time you made this telephone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. No, no. I make that call in my own office. We never make it in
their presence.</p>

<p>Now, when I got this information, and she told me&mdash;her name was also Oswald,
Mrs. Robert Oswald, we will say&mdash;she told me that this money would
be sent. I went in, and this was the first contact that I had with Mr. Oswald.
I&mdash;excuse <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You first called the home of Robert Oswald in Texas and spoke
to his wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And she told you that she would call her husband and find
out if they could make the money available? Did she then call you back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I can't remember whether it was just that way. I'm uncertain
about that. I'm sorry about that. I think that she said, "I will call him
and send the money." I'm not positive, but I think that's the way it happened,
because I don't remember her calling me back.</p>

<p>In any event, I gave her all the information, gave her my name. We always,
in this kind of thing, because when the money comes in, they don't know to
whom to direct the money. So I gave her my name and told her to send the
money attention Martin Isaacs. When I went in and told the Oswalds about
this&mdash;Mrs. Oswald, of course, cannot speak English&mdash;at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you try to speak to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I tried to speak to her, but she couldn't speak a single word. And
he told me that she can't speak any English. But when I told him that I contacted
his sister-in-law, he was quite angered, he was really very upset, and
told us, told me that he did not want to accept this money, that this was a
brother who did not have a large income, and that we should meet this cost
ourselves. And I told him what our policy was, that in all instances we are
required by law to request that relatives or friends, if there are such friends
available, meet these expenses, if they can.</p>

<p>Now, in this instance, his sister-in-law said that she would send the money,
so we would have to accept this. He did not want to accept our decision on
this. He insisted that he see the administrator of our office, because he wanted
to protest my having made this phone call and asking for the money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You had done this without telling <span class="locked">him&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That you were going to do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. We as a rule do not have to ask these people. What we can
do in some instances is to find out what the occupation of the relative is, which
I think we got in our intake interview. You see, I'm not positive about this,
again, because I think that the worker got his&mdash;the brother's name and address,
whatever other information they usually get about relatives.</p>

<p>Anyhow, to expedite matters, we always do it just this way. This is not
anything unusual with us. We call, and if we are lucky, and somebody&mdash;someone
tells us that they can send the money, we use these funds to meet the
transportation expenses to the place they are requesting to return to.</p>

<p>Let's see&mdash;you want me&mdash;excuse me. Did you want me to continue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; please go right ahead and tell us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Because he protested so vehemently, I went to the administrator,
or Mrs. Ruscoll, the administrator, and asked her what we were to do about
this matter, and she decided to interview Mr. Oswald herself.</p>

<p>I do know that Mrs. Ruscoll spent considerable time with Mr. Oswald, although
I don't know just what had transpired between them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were not present during that conference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I was not present, yes, sir; during her interview with him.</p>

<p>Later, however, she informed me that she telephoned Miss Elliott of the New
York State Department of Social Welfare, who instructed Mrs. Ruscoll to use
these funds despite his protestations, which we proceeded to do, and Mrs.
Ruscoll then notified him personally that these funds have to be used for the
family's return fare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did not have the final conversation with Oswald on that
subject yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I had no conversation with him&mdash;my conversation with him
was quite brief. My conversation consisted of just telling him that we were
using these funds. It was a most brief conversation, as I remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did you have any other contact with Oswald after Mrs.
Ruscoll told him that these funds had to be used?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I don't believe I did have any. I can't remember. What I did,
I think, was to instruct the investigator to take him to some hotel downtown
that he would have to stay at until arrangements could be made for his return
the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So Oswald then, as far as you know, stayed in New York overnight
that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. As far as I know, that is what happened, and I think that the
investigator was instructed to get him out the next morning, I believe it was.</p>

<p>Incidentally, Mr. Liebeler, we did not have to spend any money on him at
all. He had some money on him when he arrived here. I don't remember
exactly how much he had, but he said that he could meet the expense at the
hotel, as I recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you yourself prepare any reports on the Oswald case, Mr.
Isaacs, as best you can recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. When you say "reports," I would like you to be specific.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you dictate a memorandum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Yes. My telephone conversation with his sister-in-law I believe
was dictated in there. I don't remember now whether I indicated or not that
he would not not accept our decision. I might have put that in there to point up
the fact that I reported this to the administrator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember whether you had this difficulty with Lee
Oswald immediately after you called Texas, or could it have been on the next day,
do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I don't remember if there was a next day. I can't recall that at
all, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The best of your recollection is that you saw him just on one day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Yes. I don't remember whether there was any other time that I
saw him. I think he was in the office that one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is the address of your office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. 42 Franklin Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that is where Mr. Oswald came in at that time; is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether Lee Oswald had talked to his brother,
Robert, about this money that Robert was going to send to New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I don't recall whether he&mdash;not in my presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And to the best of your recollection, you did not learn from any
other source that he had talked to Robert Oswald about it; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. That is right, I think that is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any conversation with Oswald as to his return
from Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I don't recall having such a conversation with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recall being interviewed by the FBI in connection with
this matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Oh, yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have a report of an FBI interview that indicates that you had
told the FBI agent that you received the impression that Oswald had had difficulty
in leaving Russia, but you recalled a statement by Oswald to the effect
that he "caused so much trouble in Russia that they had to send me back home."
Do you remember saying anything like that to the FBI agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I don't recall saying anything like that. Of course, this is what
the intake worker had said, and this is what was circulated around in the office,
but I don't recall having&mdash;I did not speak with Oswald, and I don't recall having
gotten this from him myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Had you heard statements in the office to the effect that Oswald
had said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You understood that Oswald had made a statement such as this
to the intake worker when he came into the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Probably he made that statement to the intake worker; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Had you heard in the office that he had made that statement to
the intake worker, or was it just conversation in the office, that <span class="locked">Oswald&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I think it was conversation, rather than anything else, as I remember
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We have obtained a file from the New York City Department of
Welfare which contains certain documents relating to the Oswald case, and I
would like to mark as Exhibit No. 1 on the deposition of Martin Isaacs, April 16,
1964, at New York, N.Y., a document entitled "History Sheet," consisting of eight
pages, fastened together with a clip. I have initialed the first page of this exhibit,
Mr. Isaacs, and I would like to have you initial it next to my initials, if
you would, so that we have no confusion as to the identification of this document.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>(Document entitled "History Sheet," consisting of eight pages, marked Exhibit
1.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is, is it not, a document which was taken from the files
provided by the New York City Welfare Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. This is, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recognize it as a type of report that is prepared at a
time when a client appears in your office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recognize it as the history sheet relating to Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I show you a single sheet which is entitled "Resource Summary"
and ask you if you recognize that as a form that is usually filled out by
an applicant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I do recognize this as a form that we use in the department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That particular form here appears to be a carbon, does it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. What happens is that the original goes to the resource consultant.
We have a special section of the Department of Welfare that receives these
forms, and if it has any material on there that warrants further investigation
the resource section conducts the investigation, but in this instance, as you will
note, they said no resources in each place in the form, and we just filed this in
our record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The original of that would have been filed in the records of
the resource consultant; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I believe so, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I will mark the single sheet entitled "Resource Summary" as
Exhibit No. 2 on the deposition of Mr. Martin Isaacs, April 16, 1964, in New
York, N.Y. I have initialed that document also, Mr. Isaacs, and ask that you
initial it for the purposes of identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>(Document entitled "Resource Summary" marked Exhibit 2.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recognize that particular resource sheet as the resource
sheet that was filled out in connection with the Lee Oswald case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have marked as Exhibit No. 3 on the deposition of Mr. Martin
Isaacs, April 16, 1964, in New York, N.Y., a memorandum from Lula Jean
Elliott, senior welfare consultant, to Mrs. Ruscoll, supervisor of the special
services welfare center, dated June 14, 1962, relating to the repatriation from
the U.S.S.R. of Oswald, Lee, and family, consisting of wife and 4 months' infant.
I have initialed the memorandum to which I have just referred and
request that you do the same for the purposes of identification, down at the
bottom.</p>

<p>(Witness complies.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recognize this as memorandum from Miss Elliott?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Lula Jean Elliott.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To Mrs. Ruscoll?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That memorandum came from the files of the New York State
Department of Welfare in connection with the Oswald case? You recognize
that, do you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. I do, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any recollection of any other event that you yourself
personally experienced with Oswald during this short contact that you
had with him that you haven't told us about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. There was nothing else that I could remember that was different
from what I had told you. It was just this flare-up with him, which was
somewhat dramatic, and because it was I thought it merited bringing it to
the attention of the administrator. We don't always request that an administrator
get in on a situation with us, because she's not always available, and
she as a rule does not want to get involved. But in this particular case because
it was a repatriate, and we do deal with repatriates in a somewhat different
manner&mdash;the Federal Government is involved, because they reimburse us 100
percent for all expenses&mdash;we did deem it necessary in this particular instance
to bring it to the attention of the administrator.</p>

<p>But to answer your original question, there was nothing else that I can recall.
I remember, just as they were leaving the office, walking in that direction
to just see that they were going down the elevator&mdash;we assigned a worker&mdash;it
wasn't Mr. Lehrman, as I remember; it was some other worker&mdash;to just go
with them to the hotel and help them along with their luggage, et cetera.</p>

<p>The only other thing that I can remember was the administrator taking
his wife into the office&mdash;the clients very rarely go into the interior of the
office&mdash;and bringing her back toward her office. It's an office that's over a
block long&mdash;or a block long&mdash;and later I learned that she brought her there
because Mrs. Oswald wanted to breastfeed the child <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So the administrator took her back into the office? To feed the
child?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Yes; to feed the child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What prompted you to call this case to the attention of the
administrator? Was it, as you have indicated, simply that it was a repatriation
case, or was it because of some peculiarity in the behavior of this individual,
or was it a combination of those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Well, I would say it was a combination. He was rather severe
in his manner&mdash;for want of a better description at this time. He was insistent.
He stomped around and simply would not accept the decision that this money
would be forthcoming. And as a rule we don't get this kind of reaction from
the clients that we deal with. They accept this kind of service that they get
from us, and in fact they are very happy to receive it, and they are very grateful.
In this case we had a different kind of attitude. It was one of resentment,
and we couldn't, at least on my level I felt I couldn't insist that he take
it until&mdash;rather accept the decision until I cleared with the administrator.</p>

<p>Now, even Mrs. Ruscoll found it necessary because of his&mdash;I assume because
of the discussion that she had with him, she found it necessary to call Miss
Elliott, and Miss Elliott did, of course, supervise our section, and her decision
was to be final, and this is the decision we used.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any other information in respect of this incident
or in respect of Oswald generally that you can think of at this time that you
think might be helpful in connection with this report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. Well, I don't have any other information. All I can say is that
when this incident occurred, it did not cross our mind that the&mdash;the name Oswald
meant nothing to us. It did not cross our minds that this was the person,
and when we were looking at this on TV and just hearing the story without
actually getting a visual picture of Lee Oswald it still didn't register with us.
It was after I had seen the picture on the screen and was horrified&mdash;well, we
were horrified without having seen that, but the additional horror because it
was somebody that you had actually met and helped to return to Texas.</p>

<p>At that point I called Mrs. Ruscoll and asked her if she knew who this Lee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
Oswald was. She said she was calling Miss Bloomfield, who is her&mdash;the field
supervisor, and they said that&mdash;Mrs. Ruscoll said that she's pretty certain that
this is the person that we had met and helped to return to Texas, and it was
that&mdash;I think it was that telephone conversation that was responsible for her
having the case record pulled the very next morning by our central office. Miss
Bloomfield works out of central office, and she&mdash;the case was no longer there,
and she gave it to the commissioner, as I remember it, and, of course, then I
read it in the newspaper that the commissioner had given this record to the
FBI.</p>

<p>Now, beyond that, I really&mdash;I wish I could be more helpful, but I am sorry
to say that this is all I know about the case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have been very helpful, Mr. Isaacs. On behalf of the
Commission I want to thank you very much for coming in this afternoon and
giving us the testimony and producing the records that you have. It is another
example of the way in which the City of New York has cooperated with the
Commission and with the FBI in its work. We appreciate it very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isaacs</span>. We are only too happy to help.</p>

<h2 id="t330"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_PAULINE_VIRGINIA_BATES" id="TESTIMONY_OF_PAULINE_VIRGINIA_BATES">TESTIMONY OF PAULINE VIRGINIA BATES</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Pauline Virginia Bates was taken at 5:32 p.m., on March 25,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Albert E. Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Bates, will you stand and be sworn, please?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear in your testimony which you are about to give, to tell
the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It's Mrs. Bates, is it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. It's Miss. I'm not married. It's optional&mdash;I have been. My
name is Pauline.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Pauline Virginia&mdash;isn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is Pauline Virginia Bates.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bates, I am Albert E. Jenner, Jr. I am a member of the legal staff
for the Presidential Assassination Commission and have been authorized by the
Commission to depose you&mdash;take your deposition, make inquiries of you with
respect to the subject matter of the inquiry of the Commission.</p>

<p>Did you receive, oh, last week, I would think, a letter from J. Lee Rankin,
general counsel for the Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And enclosed with that letter is a copy of the Executive order
of President Lyndon B. Johnson on November 29, 1963, Number 11130, and a
copy of the Senate Joint Resolution, Number 137, authorizing the creation of the
Commission, together with a copy of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, Mrs. Bates, you appear voluntarily at our request?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Commission, as you have noted from those enclosed papers,
has been ordered, directed to inquire into all facts and circumstances surrounding,
leading up to, and those appearing after the assassination of John
F. Kennedy, the President of the United States, and any contacts on your part
with any of the parties.</p>

<p>We understand that you, during his lifetime, had some contact with Lee
Harvey Oswald and I think, in fact, transcribed some manuscript notes of his?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. They weren't transcribed; they were copied.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You copied them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I meant transcribed in that sense. You transcribed them
from longhand into typing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, some of them were typewritten, some of them were written
in longhand pencil, some of it was written in pen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, is that so.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. It was scraps of paper. Some of it was on just like bag paper.
Some of it was just little scraps of paper&mdash;whatever he could find.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where do you reside now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. In Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how long have you resided in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Ten years last November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your business, occupation, or profession?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. I'm a legal public stenographer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how long have you been a legal public stenographer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. In Fort Worth, 10 years&mdash;a little over 10 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is there a difference between being a legal public stenographer
and a public stenographer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, I think so. I think I'm the only one in Fort Worth that
has legal training.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's what I wish to bring out. You are a public stenographer
and you seek to direct your talents primarily toward law work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lawyers, court reporting, and that sort of thing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh&mdash;well, I haven't done any court reporting. I have done
work for court reporters&mdash;transcribe for them, and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you a citizen of the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are a native born American?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;Forest Grove, Oreg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long have you resided in the Fort Worth-Dallas area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Ten years last November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you came from where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Oakland, Calif.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was your business or occupation when you were in
Oakland, Calif.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Legal stenographer&mdash;legal secretary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That has always been your&mdash;insofar as you have had a business
or occupation&mdash;it's been that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Except during the war when I worked in the shipyards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Out on the coast?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Richmond. I have also been a waitress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Bates, if anything seems personal to you, it's not intended
as being personal. I'm trying to set the background. And you are at liberty at
any time to say to me that you think maybe I'm going too far.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. I don't have anything to hide.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. I'm sure you don't.</p>

<p>During the time you lived in the Fort Worth-Dallas area, did you have occasion
to come in contact with a person known as Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. He was known to me as Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. With a person known as Lee Oswald? And, just so
we understand each other, is the person you knew as Lee Oswald and the person
I just called Lee Harvey Oswald the person that you understand to be the
man who was accused of the assassination of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes. He was one and the same person. I recognized him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Now, tell me the circumstances under which that acquaintanceship
arose.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. He walked into my office one day, said he had gotten my name
out of the telephone directory. It so happens it's the first one in the public
stenographers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how was he attired on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. He had dark trousers on, a white T-shirt and a blazer-type
jacket&mdash;a dark blazer-type jacket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And since he had the T-shirt, he had no tie on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. No; didn't have a shirt on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No shirt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Just a little white T-shirt&mdash;undershirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. It was in June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In June? What time of the day or night was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. It was in the morning. Let's see&mdash;I turned those records over to
the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, give me your best recollection.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. I think it was around 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning, on the 18th
of June 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. What was said by him and by you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. He asked if I could do some typing for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he identify himself first?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. No. He just walked in. It's not uncommon for people to walk
in and say, "Miss Bates, can you do some typing for me?" And I said, "Yes,
I could, what was it?" And he said it was&mdash;that he was&mdash;then, he told me he
was Lee Oswald. He said, "First, I want to find out what your prices are and
see if I can afford it." So, I gave him my price.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what did you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. I said it was either 2½ an hour or a dollar a page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A page being 8½ by 11&mdash;letter-size sheets?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes; uh-huh. And I told him it all depended on what the work
was and could I see what it was. And he said, "Yes." And he brought out
this large manilla envelope, legal size&mdash;oh, I think it was 10 by 14 or something&mdash;one
of those large ones. And he said, "I have some notes <span class="locked">here"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have a folder here [showing to witness]&mdash;is <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. No; it's one of those that folds over from the top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I appreciate that&mdash;but I'm holding this up only for size.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Oh! Well, it's approximately that long, but it was a little wider.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The length of this, I think [measuring with ruler]&mdash;it's 15 inches.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, I have some up at my office. I use them all the time to,
you know, send abstracts out in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's 15 by 9.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, I am sure, as I remember it&mdash;of course, now, this was some
time ago&mdash;it was approximately 10 by 14 or 10 by 15&mdash;and it looks like what I
use.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it had a flap on it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh. Just a regular seal at the top. I think they are Carrollton
Clasp or something like that.</p>

<p>He said that he had notes that he had smuggled out of Russia. And I looked
up at him kinda surprised. I said, "Have you been to Russia?"</p>

<p>He said, "Yes, ma'am. I just got back." And that he had smuggled these
notes out of Russia under his clothes, next to his skin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We fixed the time of this inquiry&mdash;didn't we?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes; June 18. I mean, when he first came in my office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>And that he wanted to have them typed by a professional typist. He said,
"Some of them are typed on a little portable, some of 'em are handwritten in
ink, some of 'em in pencil."</p>

<p>He said, "I'll have to sit right here with you and help you with 'em because
some of 'em are in Russian and some of them are in English." So, we agreed
that I would do it&mdash;but I hadn't seen them yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You hadn't seen the notes yet?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Huh-uh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he have a package under his arm on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes. He had it with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What agreement&mdash;you mean that you agreed that you would
do it? Had you reached a conclusion as to the rate?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, I immediately lowered it to $2 an hour. I was anxious to
get on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why did you become anxious to get on it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, anybody that had just come back from Russia and had
notes, I would like to have seen them. And he didn't look like he had&mdash;he
looked like a high school kid to me when he first came in. I thought he was just
a kid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. And I do a lot of thesis work for college and high school students.</p>

<p>And then I started asking him some questions&mdash;"Why did you go to
Russia?"&mdash;and a few things like that. Some of 'em he'd answer and some of
em he wouldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, give me your best recollection of everything that was
said on that occasion.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, I'm trying to get it in sequence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. We agreed that I would start typing the notes&mdash;and he wanted
an original and one carbon. But he would take the carbon&mdash;he wanted the
original and one carbon and also take the carbon with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He didn't want to <span class="locked">leave&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. I couldn't keep a copy of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you agree that you would do the job under those circumstances?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. That's what he wanted&mdash;and my customers are always right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Then, I asked him how come he had gone to Russia. I said, "It
can't be very easy. How did you arrange it? Why did you want to go?"</p>

<p>And he said he had just gotten&mdash;he had gotten out of the Marine Corps and
had taken elementary Russian&mdash;a course in elementary Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. While he was in the Marine Corps, as I understood him. He
wasn't very talkative. And whenever I did get him to talk, I had to drag it out
of him. He didn't talk voluntarily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. And that he had wanted to travel and so he applied to the State
Department for a visa. And I asked him if he was an exchange student&mdash;if
he went over as an exchange student. Sometimes&mdash;I didn't know. I was kinda
ignorant about things like that.</p>

<p>He said, "No"&mdash;that the State Department finally agreed to let him go over,
but they would not be responsible for him; he was granted a visa to go over
there but the State Department refused to stand behind him in case he got
in trouble or anything.</p>

<p>So, he went. And that's all I got out of him, then, about that.</p>

<p>And then we got busy and he opened this large package and he brought out
the notes. And, as I said, they were on scraps of paper not even this big, some
of them [indicating with finger], and some of them large pieces of paper, some
of them were typed, some of them handwritten in ink and pencil. And he said
that he had had to just do it when he could. And it was about the living
conditions and the working conditions in Russia. And they were very bitter
against Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His writings were bitter against working conditions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. And living conditions. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say when he had prepared these notes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Just whenever he could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yeah. Oh, they were all done in Russia. And he smuggled them
out of Russia. And he said that the whole time until they got over the border,
they were scared to death they would be found, and, of course, they would not
be allowed to leave Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he imply that Marina was aware that he had these notes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. He didn't say. He just mentioned his wife once or twice in the
3 days he was up there. And, at the <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were these 3 successive days?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh; 18th, 19th, and 20th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he spend substantially all day with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. No; it was 8 hours altogether in the 3 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was 8 hours that you worked, or 8 hours that he was there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. I worked. And&mdash;uh&mdash;I spent 8 hours typing 10 pages, single-spaced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which would indicate to me, as a lawyer, that you were having
some trouble interpreting these notes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Oh, he'd&mdash;he had to spell things out for me and&mdash;uh&mdash;it was
partly in Russian. And he had to transpose it&mdash;I mean, translate it for me.
And&mdash;uh&mdash;it was&mdash;uh&mdash;very difficult to read. A lot of it was scribbled. He
would scribble notes and, then, to refresh his memory on it&mdash;he said he had to
do it surreptitiously [witness pronounced word phonetically <i>surreptiously</i>],
he just had to do it when Marina would cover for him while he was doing this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Marina would cover for him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh&mdash;muffle the tone of the typewriter and everything so
people wouldn't know that he was&mdash;what he was doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Marina was aware, then, according to what he said to
you, that he was making these notes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, evidently&mdash;because he said she would cover or watch for
him so that nobody would know that he was making them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Kind of&mdash;try to steer anybody away while he was doing this&mdash;because
he could have got in trouble.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. He didn't talk very much. He&mdash;well, there wasn't much time
to talk when you're typing and trying to translate things like that. And he was
very cool <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Cool? You mean reserved?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Cold.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Cold?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Very matter of fact?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes; and if he didn't want to answer a question&mdash;if you asked
him a question, no matter how simple it was, if he didn't want to answer it,
he'd just shut up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He'd just ignore you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>He said he was living with his brother out in Arlington Heights. Well, I
lived in Arlington Heights, and I recognized the area he lived in by the telephone
number. I said, "Well, where do you live, Lee? I have lived out in that part of
town."</p>

<p>He said, "Arlington Heights."</p>

<p>So&mdash;that's&mdash;that just closed the subject right there. He had nothing else to
say. In other words&mdash;"Just don't say anything more."</p>

<p>And&mdash;uh&mdash;I didn't even know he had a mother. He never mentioned his
mother. He mentioned his brother; he mentioned his wife&mdash;said she liked it
over here very much, that she got very ill from the food because it was too rich.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He said that she had become ill?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh. That she got the stomach ache, or something, because
they hadn't had enough food in a long time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your impression was that <span class="locked">they&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. He hadn't even been here a month, I don't think, <span class="locked">when&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, he arrived June 12&mdash;so, he was only&mdash;when he reached your
place, it was on the 18th. He had just been here 6 days.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>It might help you to read that [referring to articles in local Fort Worth papers
which witness brought with her].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I will in a moment.</p>

<p>I want to get from you&mdash;what was his attitude toward Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, he never did talk much about it, as far as that goes. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
these notes, it was&mdash;uh&mdash;the terrible living conditions and the terrible working
conditions and&mdash;uh&mdash;he did say, "Anything you hear about vacations and those
big May Day celebrations, that's all propaganda." He said, "You don't get
vacations." And he said, "These May Day celebrations&mdash;yes; they have them,
but you're forced to go. It's not a voluntary thing. And if you have a radio
or a television and you don't listen to it, you better have a good explanation
because all you hear is party politics and you've got to listen to it. You don't
have coffee breaks and you go to work before dawn and you get off after dark."</p>

<p>And the notes were very, very bitter about Russia. And he never once mentioned
the word "Communist."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Either in his notes or orally to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. He just said "the party."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Party? Those are the words he used&mdash;the expression,
rather?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>And he said you couldn't talk, you couldn't express anything because there was
always a party person around and he'd report you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. He didn't talk very much. Just helped me with the translation
and the notes&mdash;to read them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything to you about any effort on his part to become
a citizen of Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Didn't know anything about it. Oh, another thing he said that
he was very bitter about&mdash;he went over there on a 2-year visa and, of course,
he married Marina. At the end of the 2 years when he wanted to leave, they
wouldn't let him bring her back. They said, "You go ahead and we'll send
her to you."</p>

<p>"Well, of course," he said, "I knew I'd never see her again."</p>

<p>So, he stayed 11 months longer until he could get her and he raised so much
cain until they finally let him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Raised cain with whom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. The Russians.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. He wouldn't leave&mdash;his visa was out but he wouldn't leave until
they let her go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Did he express orally to you any views or opinions respecting the Government
of the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you gather anything with respect to his attitude toward the
United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. No; I've thought and thought&mdash;and, of course, I've been asked
questions all along. And he didn't discuss anything. If you got 10 words out
of him at a time, you were doing good. He just didn't talk&mdash;except explaining
those notes and, at times, he would go into detail on them. Conversations&mdash;he
had actual conversations that he had had with different people over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, he had?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. If you could find those notes, I tell you&mdash;they were fascinating
to read. "Inside Russia"&mdash;was what it was. And they were coherent and
they were well written. And he had them all in sequence. I mean, they weren't
just haphazard. He had them all in sequence according to city and dates and
things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How was his spelling?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, the English was fair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The spelling?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was an accurate speller?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Fair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He had misspelled words, though, occasionally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Oh, yeah. Mostly, I'd say, I don't know whether it was misspelled
or just that he got in a hurry and left letters out. But there's very
few men that are good spellers. I shouldn't say that but <span class="locked">it's&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am&mdash;when I have my secretary.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yeah [laughter].</p>

<p>College students are notoriously bad spellers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Particularly law students.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well&mdash;no&mdash;particularly psychology majors. They're terrible!</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you type all of his notes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. No; not even a third of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me that circumstance.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, on the 20th, he came up and he was&mdash;uh&mdash;quite nervous.
Uh&mdash;the other 2 days, he'd sit right there at my desk and&mdash;uh&mdash;if I needed to
ask him anything, why I would. But this day, he was walking up and down and
looking over my shoulder and wanting to know where I was&mdash;and, finally, I
finished the 10th page. He said, "Now, Pauline, you told me what your charges
were." He said, "This is 8 hours you've worked and 10 pages. I have $10,
and no more money. And I can't let you go on."</p>

<p>And that's when I asked him if I couldn't go on and type the rest of them.
I told him I'd do it for nothing, or if he got the money, why he could pay me.</p>

<p>And he said, "No, I don't work that way. I've got $10." And he pulled a $10
bill out of his pocket and walked out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you in possession of these notes from day to day or did
he take them back with him at night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Oh, he took them with him. He never left anything. And he
never left the office until he had picked up what I had typed&mdash;even the carbon
paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Even the carbon paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Oh yeah. He took the carbon paper.</p>

<p>He did tell me that&mdash;I think it was the second day&mdash;that there was a man
in Fort Worth&mdash;and he's an engineer. I can't remember. I've scratched my
brain on that, too, trying to remember&mdash;I just saw the letterhead for a minute&mdash;that
was interested in having these notes put into book form&mdash;manuscript form.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does the name George De Mohrenschildt refresh your recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. No. Uh&mdash;I just got a glimpse of the letterhead, and it didn't
register with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But it sounded like a man who is an engineer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. He said he was an engineer&mdash;he told me that. But there's
lots of engineers <span class="locked">in&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. And that he was interested in helping Lee get these notes published.
And he said, of course, he would have to change names and things like
that. He had actual Russian names of people he talked to. And in order to
protect people, he'd have to change the names. But the man was willing to&mdash;uh&mdash;wanted
to go ahead. He had read all the notes. I never did read all of
them. Now, this is what Lee told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lee told you that this other <span class="locked">person&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh, this engineer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the impression is yours that he was an engineer; had read
all the notes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh. Lee told me he had shown him the notes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Now, I don't know whether he had read them all or not. Maybe
I shouldn't say. He said, "I've shown him the notes."</p>

<p>And the man could read and speak Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. That much he did tell me.</p>

<p>And I just&mdash;uh&mdash;the next day when he came up was when he was real nervous
and excited, sort of excited, like, I don't know. I'm afraid to say. I don't
like to give impressions because they could be wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. But he showed no emotion at any time. The man just never
showed any emotion. He had the deadest eyes I ever saw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh. Did he talk about his wife?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes&mdash;uh&mdash;some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. That&mdash;uh&mdash;she loved America and had wanted to come and that
she liked it here very much and hoped that they could get work and stay.
And that she&mdash;uh&mdash;couldn't get over walking down the streets, and the shops&mdash;and
that New York had just astounded her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. And Texas climate&mdash;uh&mdash;was really good for her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The climate, you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>And&mdash;uh&mdash;he never mentioned his mother. He never mentioned that he had
a child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any of the notes you transcribed, was a child mentioned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. No, sir; I didn't know he had any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any notes that you transcribed, did he reach the point at
which he had married Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Never mentioned her. But he told me that he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What impression do you have as to the period of time in Russia
that was covered by the notes that you typed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, it was on Minsk and&mdash;uh&mdash;that one that starts with "K"&mdash;two
cities&mdash;and he must have been on them for the whole time he was over there,
because he told me he had to just do it when he could get the time and get
away from people.</p>

<p>And I don't think it was anything that could have been gotten together in
just a few months. It was too detailed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh. I see.</p>

<p>And your thought is that you typed about a third of his notes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. About&mdash;from the pile. I don't know how much more there was,
really, because they were all sizes&mdash;the paper was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, also, he didn't permit you to look at the balance?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. No; I just saw the envelope. I typed 10 full single-spaced pages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was letter size?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Letter size. Uh-huh. And that's a lot of words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. I wish I could remember more about them but&mdash;uh&mdash;I think my
legal training came forth there&mdash;you forget things deliberately when you're
not suppose to remember things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. All I remember is the terrible living conditions in Russia and
the terrible working conditions.</p>

<p>They are both the same, Mr. Jenner [referring to two copies of the Fort Worth
Press, which Mr. Jenner was perusing].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They are?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh. One is the first edition and the other is the final edition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. But the text of the story is the same?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you relate that experience of yours to anybody at the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, after I&mdash;uh&mdash;after he left, a short time afterward, Caroline
Hamilton and I are good friends. She's a reporter on the Press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's the Fort Worth Press?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>And we were having lunch one day down at the corner drugstore and talking
about, oh, just this, that, and the other thing, and I said, "By the way, Caroline,
I did a real interesting job the other day. And the boy that I did it for is broke
and out of a job, and you might be able to help him."</p>

<p>So, I gave her Lee's name and telephone number. That's all he gave me&mdash;was
the telephone number&mdash;his brother's telephone number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. And they tried to contact him but couldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could not <span class="locked">contact&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Lee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
I just thought maybe they might be able to find him work, or something like
that, because he wasn't working. He hadn't gotten a job. And he was real
worried about it, because he needed one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. And I just thought maybe that they might be able to help him
find a job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they were unable to contact him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. They couldn't find him. They went out to his brother's home
several times&mdash;oh, I think, two or three times, she said&mdash;one of the reporters
did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when was this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Oh, it was shortly after I did the work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. In the summer of 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh; he was still out&mdash;I guess he was still out there&mdash;but
there was never anybody at home when they went out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. And, actually, I didn't know that Lee was the accused assassin.
I didn't see any television, or anything else, the day that the President was
killed. I was still under such a shock because I had just seen him go down the
street in front of my building and I could have shaken hands with him&mdash;and
it was a terrible shock&mdash;until Caroline called me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh; that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. That night of the assassination.</p>

<p>And wondered, she said&mdash;I was out at my club&mdash;and she said, "Have you seen
any television or listened to any radios?"</p>

<p>And I said, "No."</p>

<p>She said, "Well, have you got a television there?"</p>

<p>And I said, "Yes."</p>

<p>She said, "Turn it on&mdash;and then call me back."</p>

<p>So, I did. And there he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the person you saw on television&mdash;this would be the night
of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You recognized as being the same person who you knew as Lee
<span class="locked">Oswald&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And whose notes you typed on the 18th, 19th, and 20th of June?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were firm in your recognition of that person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Oh, yes. There was no doubt about it. His eyes alone would&mdash;you
could recognize. And when I also heard him talk, I knew that's who it
was.</p>

<p>That's all there is [referring to newspaper that Mr. Jenner was perusing
again].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These first two pages?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When Miss Hamilton called you, I take it she came over and
talked with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Not until the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, it was delayed for awhile. Let's see&mdash;Thanksgiving was the
following week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Caroline said, "Well, do you want to do something about it?"</p>

<p>I said, "No; not now. Wait until I gather my thoughts and see if I'm
advised what to do. I don't want to do anything that I shouldn't do."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Because he hadn't been&mdash;he had not been&mdash;uh&mdash;charged then
even with the assassination. He'd just been picked up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. So, then she called me Wednesday morning before Thanksgiving
and she said, "Let's do a story on it." So, we sat all Wednesday afternoon and
talked. So&mdash;it wasn't any spur of the moment thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. I wasn't meaning to suggest that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. No, no; I know that. But we tried to make it just the 3 days
he was in my office&mdash;and that was a little difficult to do because of all the things
that happened since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; in the interim.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see him or hear of him from that time forward&mdash;that
is, the 20th of June, 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. I saw him on the street twice after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, you did? This was in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh. He didn't see me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He didn't see you and you didn't greet him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Oh, he was a half a block or a quarter of a block away. I was
going down Houston Street to the bank and he was going into this&mdash;uh&mdash;variety
store&mdash;Green's, or Grant's, I think it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anybody with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. No; he was by himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever meet Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. No; his mother called me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When&mdash;after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. The day the story broke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This story that you've shown me?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh. She told me not to talk to anybody until I had talked
to her. I said, "Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Oswald, you're too late." She said, "That
is not the property&mdash;that is my property."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is her property?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. She said, "I knew that Lee had had a public stenographer do some
work but I never could find out who." And I said, "Mrs. Oswald, I didn't even
know he had a mother in Fort Worth. He never spoke of her." She said, "Well,
don't talk to anyone until I have talked to you." I said, "Well, you're just a
little bit too late."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she ever come out to see you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was the only conversation you ever had with her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yeah&mdash;uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am going to show you pages 148 through 157 of a bound document
on the cover of which appears the title, "Affidavits and Statements Taken
In Connection With the Assassination Of The President." These pages are
photostatic copies of what purport to be some manuscript notes. Are you familiar
with the handwriting of Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As you look at those documents&mdash;would you leaf through all the
pages I have mentioned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes [complying]. It would be pretty hard&mdash;oh! wait a minute!
wait a minute!</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is for the purpose of inquiring of you, first, whether that's
his handwriting and, secondly, whether you recognize any of that material?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As things that he had in his notes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. (Continuing to peruse notes) Metropole&mdash;uh-huh&mdash;Minsk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are now referring to page 149?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You see something that is familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were any of the notes that he tendered to you on the punched,
ring book paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. I believe some of them were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And were any of the notes on the lined paper with the ruled
left-hand margin?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Every kind of paper imaginable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, do you recognize some of them as being on paper of that
character?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, some of his notes were in longhand, were they not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes; in pencil and pen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In pencil and in pen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. His pen would run out and he would start in on pencil.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, is that handwriting familiar to you as compared with the
handwriting of Lee Oswald, or what he said was his handwriting, when you
transcribed his notes for 3 days?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. It looks very much&mdash;as I remember it&mdash;it looks very much like it.</p>

<p>[The witness points to a particular page.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The witness is referring to page 149 which seems particularly to
attract her attention. The head of that is "Resident of U.S.S.R." Does that
page awaken your recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh&mdash;very definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about it awakens your recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, as I remember, that's the way his notes started out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That [reading from notes] "I lived in Moscow from October 16,
1959, to January 4, 1960, during which time I stayed at the Berlin and Metropole
Hotel"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh. That is as I remember&mdash;as I can remember&mdash;and that's
all I can do, my recollection is that that's the way they started out&mdash;just like a
story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. A diary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he take his notes with him, too, when <span class="locked">he&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Took everything. He wouldn't allow me to keep anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you go through those pages and see if you recognize any
other of the story type of thing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. [Complying.] Uh-huh. It was strictly Russian&mdash;on Russia&mdash;his
trip to Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, at that time, he had just returned from Russia and it
would appear from the notes that you have examined that the later notes deal
with his subsequent residence in the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yeah; which I knew nothing about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, it occurred afterward, in any event.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh. I mean, I had never heard of the man before and I
didn't hear of him afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the story in The Fort Worth Press&mdash;front page story in
The Fort Worth Press of Friday, November 29, 1963, volume 48, No. 50, final
home edition, which you have kindly brought with you today, and which is
marked Bates Exhibit No. 1 and is offered in evidence.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. You may have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you. And that is the <span class="locked">story&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was written by Miss Caroline Hamilton, Press staff writer,
as you have described?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that story accurate as you related it to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there anything in the story that you would like to amend
or correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. No, sir. It was read to me before it was ever printed twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is Bates Exhibit No. 1 and is offered in evidence.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. And we did it very carefully to make it all&mdash;so we wouldn't get
the past and the present mixed up. We kept it to the 3 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall being interviewed by the FBI on December 2, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes; let's see, that was a Saturday, wasn't it&mdash;December 2?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. [Referring to calendar] December 2 was a Monday.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, no; they came to my home on Saturday after the story
broke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they interview you twice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, they didn't interview me the second time really. They
just&mdash;uh&mdash;I had received a letter, I think it was, that I turned over to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. Could it have been Saturday, the 30th of November?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. It was the following Saturday after the story broke. Saturday
the 30th of November. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall saying to the FBI men who interviewed you that
the story was <span class="locked">accurate&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes, sir; gave him a copy of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In every detail, with one exception&mdash;which was that Lee Oswald
never stated that he was working for the U.S. State Department.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, that is not in the story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me about that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. That was what&mdash;the radio and television was trying to put words
in my mouth at that time. And&mdash;uh&mdash;I don't know how many times I had to
call and tell them to retract that. I never stated that. I stated that when he
first said that he went to Russia and had gotten a visa that I thought&mdash;it was
just a thought&mdash;that maybe he was going over under the auspices of the State
Department&mdash;as a student or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. From that, they got that he was a secret agent for <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>If you think that's bad, you ought to see what they did to me over the weekend.
I had to get them to retract&mdash;according to the Associated Press Monday they
had it on the wire that you people had come out to my house over the weekend
and interviewed me&mdash;and I was on my way to Washington Monday!</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean, this past weekend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Yes; The Star Telegram called me <span class="locked">Monday&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. And asked me about it and I said, "I don't know what you are
talking about."</p>

<p>And they said, "Well, somebody has just jumped the gun."</p>

<p>And I said, "Well, you'd better do something about it. That's not true. And
I certainly don't want to get in trouble with those people."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think some one of the young men around here told me that&mdash;but
I put no stock in it, <span class="locked">so&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, I didn't know anything about it. I don't have a telephone
at home. I had it taken out. And there wasn't any way anybody could contact
me. I did get my letter Friday. But that's all. Well, they had me on the
plane Monday to Washington! [laughing]. That's the press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They try to put two and two together and hope they'll hit it one
out of three times.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, anyhow, The Star Telegram took care of it. They said
that I had gotten the letter&mdash;that they understood I had gotten the letter and
I would be called as a witness&mdash;and that was it.</p>

<p>I told them&mdash;I said, "You'd better get that off the wires because it's not
true&mdash;and I'm certainly not going to be accountable for anything like that. No
one has contacted me except by letter." But they were putting all kinds of
words in my mouth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They hadn't talked to you at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The newspaper people over this weekend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. No; I don't have a phone at home. And I was home very ill
with bursitis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, you were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. I've got it right now. It's about to drive me crazy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's pretty bad stuff.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. But, all this stuff about the Secret Service, I mean, that's
strictly radio and television and reporters. The UP and the Associated Press
drove me crazy calling me at 2 and 3 in the morning&mdash;"Mrs. Bates, can't you add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
something?"&mdash;"Can't you remember something else?"&mdash;"Well, can't you elaborate?"
Well, I had one stock answer: "You cannot elaborate on the truth."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. And that's all I could remember. I didn't know the man; I
could not say anything about him except what happened in my office. And
that's all I knew about it. "Well, can't you elaborate?"&mdash;you can't elaborate
on the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; that's right. Does anything occur to you that you think
might be helpful to the Commission about which I haven't asked you&mdash;insofar
as seeking the actual facts here is concerned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. I don't know. I can't think of another thing. And I do have
to keep from giving impressions I've got now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. You have <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. I mean, disassociate the past and the present. I've got to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Because I don't know anything about the man except what
I have read&mdash;since then. And I cannot make statements on my opinions or
things like that. I don't believe in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bates, there have been a few occasions when the reporter was changing
her tape and otherwise we have been off the record, during which we have
had some conversations. Is there anything that occurred during the course
of those asides that I had with you that you think I have failed to bring out&mdash;that's
pertinent here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. No, sir; I think everything is down. In fact, we quit talking
when she was changing the tape&mdash;except for a cigarette, or something like that.</p>

<p>I wish I could help you more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So do we. But all we can do is to try to delve into this great
mystery.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bates, you have the privilege and right to read over your deposition
when it's been transcribed.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. May I have a copy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And to make any additions or corrections you see fit to make
and that you think are warranted, and to sign it. You also have the right to
waive these privileges if you see fit.</p>

<p>If you wish to take advantage of them, this transcript should, I think, be
ready along about Wednesday of next week, a week from today. If you will
call in, if I'm not in&mdash;we expect to be here&mdash;but if I'm not in, talk to the U.S.
attorney, Mr. Sanders.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. That's long distance. I live in Fort Worth. Could you get
a'hold of Agent Howard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Agent Howard? Well, we cannot let the deposition out of our
possession.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. No, no; and let him let me know when it is ready? He's the
one that brought me over and he's waiting for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, he is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, when you are driving back with Agent <span class="locked">Howard&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. I'll tell him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You tell Agent Howard to let you know when it is ready.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Okay. Because I don't have a car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Because I have a hundred things to think about and I probably
won't think about it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Would there be a possibility of having a copy of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The rules provide that if you wish a copy, you may have a copy
by paying the court reporter whatever the court reporter's regular rates are.
So, if you wish to make an arrangement with her, that's your privilege.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, I'll ask Mr. Sansom&mdash;he's a very prominent lawyer over
there&mdash;and he said he wanted a copy of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, we would not supply a copy of it to anyone else. If you
personally want a copy, you have the privilege of obtaining one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Uh-uh. Well, you couldn't afford to give anybody copies of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not only can we not afford it, but we would not sell a copy to
anybody&mdash;other than yourself.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Oh, no; of my deposition, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You may obtain a copy of your deposition by arrangement with
the reporter.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. I see what you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But, you may not do so for somebody else.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Oh, no; but I mean I want it for my files up at the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And thank you for your time and your cooperation.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. Well, I figured it might help.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="t343"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_MAX_E_CLARK" id="TESTIMONY_OF_MAX_E_CLARK">TESTIMONY OF MAX E. CLARK</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Max E. Clark was taken at 2:10 p.m., on March 25, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If you will rise and raise your right hand, please, I will place
you under oath.</p>

<p>(Complying.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to
give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Clark, my name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am a member of
the legal staff of the President's Commission investigating the assassination of
President Kennedy. Staff members have been authorized to take the testimony
of witnesses by the Commission pursuant to authority granted to the Commission
by Executive Order 11130 dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution
of Congress No. 137. I understand that Mr. Rankin sent you a letter last week
telling you I would be in touch with you, with which he enclosed copies of those
documents plus copies of the rules of procedure pertaining to the taking of
testimony. I presume you did receive those documents with that letter, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I want to take your testimony in two basic areas; first, your
knowledge of Lee Oswald gained as a result of somewhat limited contact with
him, your knowledge of his relations with this so-called Russian community
here in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and, two, to some extent, I want to ask
you about your knowledge of Mr. George De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you state your full name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Max E. Clark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are an attorney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. A member of the Bar of Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Any other State?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, I am licensed to practice in the Federal courts and American
Bar Association.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you maintain your offices in Fort Worth, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your home address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. 4312 Selkirk Drive West.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long have you been a member of the bar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Since 1939&mdash;now I have to stop and <span class="locked">think&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That's good enough; that's just fine, and you are a native-born
American, Mr. Clark?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Born here in Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, I was born in Indiana.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you move to Texas, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. In 1927.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you state for us briefly your educational background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Well, I attended public high schools in Fort Worth, graduated
and went to T.C.U., University of Texas, 1 year in the University of Arizona and
received my law degree at the University of Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your wife, I understand, was born in France and her parents
were born in Russia, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. My wife was born in France; her father is Russian and her
mother is English and Russian. I know her father was born in Russia but I
am not certain whether her mother was born in Russia or England because they
alternated back and forth so I really don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Does your wife speak Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did there come a time when you made the acquaintance of Lee
Harvey Oswald and his wife, Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us in your words the background leading up to
that; how it happened, the circumstances leading up to when you met him,
approximately when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. We first became aware of Oswald when we noticed in the newspaper
in Fort Worth that Lee Oswald, a defector, had returned to Fort Worth
with this Russian wife and very shortly after, I noticed it in the paper, possibly
the same week, my wife received a phone call from Oswald stating that he was
there and he understood she spoke Russian and her name had been given to him
as a person speaking Russian from someone from the Texas Employment Commission
and she said well, that that was true, that she had spoke some Russian
and I was at my office and we would either call&mdash;or we would call him that
weekend so she discussed it with me when I came home and on a Sunday
following that, why, I told her "Well, might as well call if the girl spoke Russian
and hadn't been able to communicate" she might as well call her; and so she
placed the call to Oswald's brother, I believe is where they were staying the
newspaper said, and talked with Oswald and suggested if he wanted to, he
and his wife could drive over to our house that afternoon and he stated to her
that it was not convenient for him, so we felt, well, we made the offer so that's
it; so we paid no further attention to him or did not make any further attempt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This first attempt of Oswald's to contact your wife did he tell
you what motivated him; was it purely a social matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Purely social; his wife could not speak English and she would
like to talk to some girl that spoke Russian so we made the offer. We were not
about to go out to his house where he was living. If he wanted to see us he
could come over there. We felt we had done enough. Shortly after that my
wife's mother was having an operation in France so it had been planned that
she would go over there during this operation, so my wife left in July, I believe,
or first of August. I have forgotten, of 1962 and was gone 7 weeks or something
like that. When she returned to Fort Worth in September or the latter part
of September, the Russian group which she keeps rather close contact with&mdash;there
is not such a large number between Dallas and Fort Worth that they communicate
quite freely back and forth&mdash;stated that they had met this Marina
Oswald and that she was having an extremely hard time and so several of
them came over from Fort Worth, I mean from Dallas to Fort Worth and asked
my wife to meet them at Oswald's house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who is this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I think it was George Bouhe and Anna Meller and I've forgotten
but I wasn't present, I don't know, but this is what my wife was telling me,
so she arranged to meet them at this apartment that the Oswalds were living
in one afternoon and she told me that she met this Marina and she looked like a
little child and had this baby and she talked with her and Oswald was apparently
working because she did not see him and then we had no further contact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
with them or even knew about them until Oswald apparently quit his job or was
fired and this Marina and the baby which was quite young at the time went to
live with a friend of ours, Elena Hall who at that time was divorced and was
living by herself and she volunteered or asked this Marina and the child to
live with her awhile. Apparently, Oswald left the city and went to Dallas to
look for a job or whether they were separated I don't know because we had
heard stories that Oswald had beat her and that it was not going very well,
their marriage, and <span class="locked">so&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Approximately when was it that Marina moved in with Elena
Hall; do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Some time in October of 1962; the exact date I don't know. I
know that she had been over there a few days when Elena Hall had an automobile
wreck late one night. We received a phone call from the hospital to pick
up this Marina and the baby and take them to the hospital because Elena was
under the impression that she had killed the baby or Marina in the car wreck.
She thought that they were involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were they in the car at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; they were not in the car but she was injured pretty badly,
apparently, during this car wreck. So, we went by to this Elena Hall's house
about 10 that night, picking up Marina and the baby and took her to the hospital
and then, of course, she had been given sedatives and&mdash;Elena Hall&mdash;and I
don't know whether she knew any more about it. I did not see her that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina see Elena Hall that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I think so but I am not sure. I know we took them to the hospital
and then we took Marina and the baby back to her home, to this Elena Hall's
home, and, of course, during&mdash;from that period while Elena was in the hospital
my wife had to take food or pick up this Marina and buy her groceries or
milk for the baby and look after her because she could not speak English and
had no transportation or any way to get food. So, usually every day my wife
would go over and either take her to the grocery or take her food.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I want to ask some detailed questions about that but before
we get into that, so I don't forget, I want to go back. You said Oswald had
told you he had gotten your name from somebody in the Texas Employment
<span class="locked">Commission&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that your recollection or in fact, did Oswald tell you that
he had gotten your name from a man by the name of Peter Gregory at the
Fort Worth Public Library?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Of course, I had no communication with Oswald at this time.
When he talked with my wife over the phone he indicated to her that he had
gotten my wife's name and Peter Gregory's name from the employment commission.
Now, I could be mistaken but apparently Mr. Gregory and my wife's
name were given to him as people that spoke Russian. Of course, we know
Mr. Gregory and then after, immediately after this came about, why, my
wife&mdash;we talked with the Gregorys. Which came first, I do not know. I
don't know who saw Oswald first. I believe Mr. Gregory saw them before we
did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know who it was in the Texas Employment Commission
that gave Oswald the name of Peter Gregory and your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No. I don't but I can understand fairly well, why. My aunt
had been employed by the Texas Employment Commission for 20, 25 years up
until her death a few years ago and then my sister still works there. I know
it wasn't my aunt because she was dead at the time but my sister, and I
have talked with her since, and it was not her and she said it could have been
any one of several. I was under the impression she said my wife said that
he had said someone by the name of Smith at the employment commission
but we don't know anybody by the name of Smith.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is the Texas Employment Commission office in Fort
Worth, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is there just one office of the Texas Employment Commission
in Fort Worth?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. There may be some branches but I don't think so. I think this
came out of the main office. Whether he called us or he called the Gregorys
first, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. One of the things that the Commission is doing in an attempt
to learn as much as we can about Oswald is we are trying to put together a
schedule of income and outgo of funds throughout the entire time he lived
in this country after he returned from Russia. I would like to have you
if you could recollect as best you can the exact amount of food, groceries or
money or other things that your wife provided to Marina Oswald while she
lived at Elena Hall's house. Do you have knowledge of those things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Actually, it was probably very small because Elena was in the
hospital, to my recollection not more than a week and during that time,
apparently there was&mdash;she bought her some groceries and I do recall she said
she bought her a carton of cigarettes. I doubt if it would exceed $10 or
$15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As far as you know the only thing that your wife did provide
to Marina were these things you described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether she gave Marina any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I am sure she did not give her any cash; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you go on with your story now, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. So, upon&mdash;when this Elena was in the hospital my wife would
see Marina about every day and I think that one evening during that week,
I took her and the baby and my wife to a restaurant for dinner one night and then
on the Sunday following this hospital treatment and while Elena was still in
the hospital, Marina asked my wife if we would come over on Sunday afternoon
and have some Russian dinner that she would prepare for us and this
Elena's ex-husband was coming into town from Odessa and if we would come
over there, 3 or 4 o'clock Sunday afternoon, she would prepare this dinner, so
we planned on going over there and we did and when we got there Oswald was
there. That was the first time either my wife or myself had met Oswald; so,
we were there, oh, I would say approximately 2 hours. Some time after we
arrived then John Hall, as I recall, came in from the hospital. He had been
over seeing his wife and then we sat around and talked and we ate later on
and then we left rather early in the evening. Well, probably, I don't recall
the time but it must have been 7 or 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether Oswald ever stayed at Elena Hall's home
while Elena was in the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I have no way of knowing. I did not think he did. It was under
my impression he was in Dallas at the time. In fact, we were quite surprised
to see him that Sunday afternoon because we had formed the impression that
Marina and he had separated. I don't know definitely because I couldn't
talk with Marina. She only spoke Russian at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did your wife have the impression that there had been marital
difficulties between the Oswalds at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us any specific reasons why your wife thought that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. None other than the conversations and the fact that Marina
seemed quite happy with him gone, more than the fact that she did not seem to
miss him and the fact that he wasn't there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During this time that you and John Hall and your wife and
Marina and Oswald were present at Elena Hall's home, did you have a conversation
with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he say and what did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Of course, I was extremely interested in, well, life in Russia and
to find out just exactly why he left in the first place and why he came back
and he was in a very talkative mood and he talked at great length about his
stay there and he seemed to want to make a point with everyone he met that
he wanted them to know he was Lee Oswald the defector. He seemed to be
quite proud of that distinction. In his opinion he thought that made him stand
out and he would always say, "You know who I am?" when he would meet someone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
for the first time, so he was not trying to keep it a secret and in talking with
him I asked him why he went to Russia. He said that he was in the Marines
and he had read a lot of Karl Marx and he had studied considerably while he
was in the Marines and he decided that he would get out of the Marines and he
would go to Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you that he studied Marxism when he was in the
Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate to you that he had studied the Russian language
while in the Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. He indicated he had because I asked him how he learned to
speak Russian and he said he studied while in the Marines and learned a lot
more when he went to Russia but apparently, he studied it quite awhile before
he left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you whether he took any formal courses or whether
this was private effort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. He did not indicate but it was my impression it was more or less
self-study and he stated that when he got his discharge from the Marines that
he went&mdash;I said, "How did you get a visa; how did you get to Russia?" He
said very simple; he just went down, made application to get a visa and what
he had to do was to put up so much money for some kind of tour and at the same
time when he put up this money for his passage, why, he got his visa stamped
and he said he went to Russia, and the minute he got to Russia, he went to the
American Embassy and told them he wanted to renounce his citizenship and
he turned in his passport and he went to see about becoming a Soviet citizen
and they told him they couldn't do it but they gave him a work permit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you why the Russians would not accept him as a
Russian citizen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; he didn't say. He indicated he had to stay there a length
of time before he could become a citizen and he already secured a work permit
card and they assigned him an apartment and he said because he was a marine
he got a better apartment. He got an apartment with a washstand and he
was quite proud of the fact he got a little better apartment than the normal
working person there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you where he was sent to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. He did and I think it was in Minsk or some place; I don't remember
exactly. He told me the name of the town; it was wherever Marina
came from. I have forgotten which one it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you any more details about his relations with the
American Embassy and the Soviet authorities when he first came to the Soviet
Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Nothing except he turned in his passport and tried to become a
Soviet citizen and they refused to make him a citizen and they gave him this
work permit and he was particularly unhappy about the fact they didn't make
a fuss about him and put him to work as a common sheet metal worker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes; he told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I asked him what it was like working there and he said the
closest comparison he could give would be like the Marine Corps. He said
if you got up so high in a job it was like being promoted to corporal, sergeant
and so forth. He said the higher you went in their jobs, the more privileges
you got and he said in his job he felt if he stayed there 5 years he might get
up maybe one rung in the ladder and he didn't think it was real communism
is the way he put it and that he thought he was completely disgruntled about
it. He said you could get a job any place and they always had about five people
to do each job; said he didn't work hard but you couldn't progress unless you
stayed in one place and made friends with the boss and he said he didn't like
that; and he said if he wanted to go to a bigger city&mdash;I said why didn't you go
to another factory if you did not like that. He said he could but then he
couldn't get an apartment or place to live and they controlled the workers by
limiting the places you could live and they assigned you an apartment and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
might take 5 years to get another one and he was quite bitter about the fact
that the managers had better houses and an automobile and the fact that
they could go to, well, to the coast or to the beach in the summer on their vacations
while he could not. I said, "Well, you were saying everyone got a month's
vacation." He said, "That's true, but you had to pay your transportation," and
it would take a year's salary to go from his place of employment down to the
Black Sea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you he had done any traveling while in the Soviet
Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. He said he was limited because he did not have the money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you how much money he was paid at his job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. As I recall, between 80 and 90 rubles and he was justifying that
on this basis, he said actually it wasn't so bad except you had your housing
taken care of and your medical expenses. That's the main things he seemed
to count most important but he said that clothing, shoes was very expensive
and traveling was extremely expensive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you that he received any income from any source
other than his job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. He said that's all he had and he had written to his mother to get
money to come back to the States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he mention receiving money from the Red Cross?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever mention to you that he had gone from Minsk to
Moscow to talk to the officials at the American Embassy about returning to
the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever tell you that Marina went from Minsk to Kharkof
for a 2- or 3-week vacation after they were married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; he did not. He said that after they were married that she
moved in this apartment with him and said they used to go out and walk around
and do some hunting of some kind; I don't know. I didn't pay much attention
to him. He said they went out for amusements for walks. I asked what he did
and he said there wasn't too much to do, go to dances once in awhile. He
indicated to me that Marina had to work up until a very short time before the
birth of the child and that she was supposed to go back to work within a month
after the birth of the child but by putting in his application to return to the
United States somehow or other she delayed in reporting back to work and
finally his permit and all to return had arrived and so that they left. She never
returned to work after the birth of the child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember specifically that he mentioned the high cost
of transportation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes; the reason I remember that is I had read an article recently
about all of the resort buildings and had seen some pictures in Life or Time
magazine on the Black Sea, this resort area, and asked him if he had been down
there as I heard it was similar to the Riviera in France. He said no, he wanted
to go there. I said, "Why didn't you go there during your vacation if you had
a month?" He said he couldn't afford it. It would take nearly a year's salary
for him to pay for the transportation. I said, "Isn't housing and food provided?"
He said, "Oh, yes; if I could have gotten there I could have a free house but
only people high up or special favors are given permission to go down there."
He was quite unhappy about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He mentioned to you that his apartment had a private bath
while most of the other apartments had to share the bath?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes; I was asking him what the apartments were like. He said
most of the apartment houses would have, for example, on one floor have two
wings; on the right wing would be a group of six apartments, would be just one
big room leading off the hall and at the end of the hall would be the bath and
kitchen and these six apartments would share that one bath and one kitchen.
And the other side of the wing would be a duplication and he said the only difference
between his and those apartments was his had a wash basin and private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
stove in there, small apartment stove so he could cook if he wanted to and he
did not have to use the communal kitchen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, you said that Marina did not go back to work after the
baby was born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. That's what he indicated to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate that that was an extraordinary situation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes; he said it was very unusual because all women were allowed
so much leave; I think he said 6 weeks before the birth of a child and 4 weeks
or something after the birth of the child in which they were not required to work
but other than that they worked the whole time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What happened to the child when they went back to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. He said they take it to special places that elderly women&mdash;they
receive their pay for taking care of the children; kind of a babysitting service
or nursery and you would drop the children off at the nursery and at the end
of the day, the mothers pick them up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he express any opinion as to this procedure? Did he think
this was a good thing or bad thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Well, he didn't seem quite&mdash;he just took it as a matter of course.
He thought that was all right. He didn't have much comment to make on
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I am looking at a report of an interview which you gave on
about November 29, 1963, to two FBI agents, Mr. Haley and Mr. Madland. Do
you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This report indicates that you told them at that time that 3
months after Oswald's child was born that his wife did go back to work and
that the government did take the child and place it in a government nursery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; I think maybe Earl must have misunderstood because when
the baby came over here it was my understanding she was less than 5 months
old. I am not sure but the baby was very young and I think Earl might
have misunderstood when I said after the mothers returned to work they were
placed in a nursery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Seems like he might have confused the general proposition
with the particular case of the Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did Oswald tell you the circumstances under which he
met and subsequently married his wife, Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Well, I have heard from him and then, of course, I think she told
my wife who gave me her version of it that he stated while he was working
as a sheet metal worker in this factory, why, there wasn't too much social activity
and he with some of his fellow workers went one evening or was in the
habit of going to a dance that they had in fact for everyone and he would go
and this one night he went there and he met Marina and so he danced with her
quite a bit and that they, after a short time, they got married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate he had had any difficulty in securing permission
to marry her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. He didn't indicate any trouble at all getting permission to marry
her and then what she told my wife was that she was quite a flirt. In other
words, she said that she made a practice of going late to the dance so she would
be fresh and then all the boys would rush to her because she would have fresh
make-up and the others would be hot and tired. So, she went late this night,
later in the evening, and arrived very fresh and she met Oswald and she
thought it was unusual to be dancing and having a boyfriend that was an American,
so she started going with him; so my wife asked her, she said "What did
your friends think about you going with an American and marrying an American
and coming to the United States?" Marina says "Well, they told me it couldn't
be any worse."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. By that she meant the United States couldn't be any worse
than the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Couldn't be worse, so she gave the impression she was quite
happy to get out of there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did your wife have the feeling that was one of the reasons
why she married Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. My wife had the impression she thought it was something new
and strange and it was something to look forward to so she was&mdash;seemed
to be as much interested in leaving Russia as staying there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did Oswald tell you what prompted him to leave the
Soviet Union and return to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes; he told me that he had finally made up his mind that he
would never get any place in the Soviet Union and that he was disappointed
because it was not like Karl Marx or was not true Communism, in his words,
and that he thought it was just as bad as a democracy and he said he wanted
to leave there because he just felt there was no hope for him there and he
would never be able to get ahead or make his mark so he decided the best bet
for both he and Marina was to leave so he made application to leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember him specifically using the words "make his
mark" or is that just an expression of yours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. That is my expression but my general impression was he wanted
to become famous or infamous; that seemed to be his whole life ambition was to
become somebody and he just seemed to have the idea that he was made for
something else than what he was doing or what particular circumstances he was
in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned previously that he did not try to hide the fact
that he was a defector and had gone to Russia and you gave the impression to me
in your testimony that he called attention to this fact and you said, if I recall it,
he would say "Well, you know who I am" when you met him. Would you think
this would be an example of what you just spoke of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes; he didn't want to be among the common people; he wanted to
stand out. He wanted everybody to know he was the defector.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And he called attention to that fact to make himself stand out
even though it might not have been a wise thing to call to peoples' attention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes; I thought it was very stupid of him but he seemed to think
it made him somebody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of any other examples of behavior on Oswald's
part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Well, he stated while he was in Russia he didn't&mdash;he was completely
disgruntled by the fact they only made him a common sheet metal worker;
that he thought since he was a defector and former Marine Corpsman that he
would be given special attention and the fact that he was quite proud of the fact
that he did rate a better apartment than the average sheet metal worker. He
was quite proud of the few accomplishments he had made and he wanted to
impress upon me that he read very much and how much he had read.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he tell you about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Oh, he said he read all the time and that he read everything he
could about communism, about Karl Marx and that he felt that it was much
better than participating in sports. I tried to see if he was interested in sports
and he wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you he was a member of any Communist or Marxist
organizations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; he didn't. We didn't get into any phase of organizations.
He was more or less discussing his particular life in Russia and what it was
like and I was interested in how he got back and why he decided to come back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate that he had any difficulty in obtaining permission
to return to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Well, I was quite surprised as to the ease in which he and Marina
and the baby had gotten permission to come back and I asked him "How did
you work that?" He said "Well, we just went down and I made application and
she was my wife and the child and told them I wanted to go back to the United
States. When I secured the passage" he said, "they okayed it." Said "We left."
He didn't seem to think it was unusual. He said that he just happened to ask at
the right place is what he indicated to me; said "Maybe these other people hadn't
hit at the right time or hadn't approached the right person."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate the U.S. Government had given him or Marina
any difficulty about them returning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. None whatsoever; the reason they hadn't because he had not
renounced his citizenship. I said "I thought you said you turned in your passport
and wanted to become a Soviet citizen?" He said "I did turn in my passport
but they didn't make me a Soviet citizen so I did not renounce my citizenship.
So when I made application to come back", he said "They couldn't keep
me out."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He ascribed this failure for this part to the renouncing of his
American citizenship to the refusal of the Russians to make him a citizen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He did not mention the U.S. Embassy or Moscow had refused to
permit him to return?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate any hostility toward the State Department or
Embassy or Moscow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. He did not seem hostile with anyone in particular. He just
thought everyone was out of step but him. He was rather an arrogant-talking
person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He did not mention specifically any government official, President
Kennedy, Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you about his service in the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Nothing except he was very unhappy while in the Marine Corps.
He didn't like any part of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did that come up in connection with his comparison of life in
the Soviet Union with life in the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I would ask him "How would you classify life in the Soviet
Union; you say everyone has a job and everyone gets a salary whether they
work or not?" He said just that they have to work. There may be five people
for each job and if you apply at a factory they got to put you on; and I said
"What prevents everyone from migrating from one place to another if they
have to take you if you make application?" He said "It's a fact they control
the movement of employees by the lack of places to live and assignment of
apartments."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He did not mention to you he received an undesirable discharge
from the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know about it at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I think it was in the paper. I felt pretty sure anyone that
would be a defector they would probably give him a dishonorable discharge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did any of the other members or any of the members of the
so-called Russian Community in the Dallas-Fort Worth area ever raise with
you the question of whether they should associate with Oswald; whether he
was a safe person for them to associate with him or have anything to do with
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I think everyone was discussing that as to whether or not
they should especially when he first came back and all of them asked me and
I said "In my opinion he is a defector and you know what he is"; I said "You
should not hold that against this girl Marina. She's having a hard time. He's
beating her up, everything is strange to her, she can't speak the language, I don't
think you should ostracize her because of Oswald." Most of them had absolutely
no use for Oswald and they discussed all the time they hated to let this girl
get beat up and kicked around by this Oswald without at least trying to look
after her. I told them I didn't see anything wrong in looking after this girl.
I said "As far as Oswald coming back here you can be assured or bet that when
he returned to the United States the FBI has got him tagged and is watching
his movements or I would be very much surprised."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If they <span class="locked">didn't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. If they didn't, I said "You know that they know exactly where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
he is in town" and I said "I imagine they know who he is contacting because I
know enough about the boys in the FBI; they would keep a record."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss Oswald with anybody in the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Not before this happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you ever had any official connection with the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; but I worked with them quite a bit when I was in security
industrial with General Dynamics; that's when I became acquainted with Earl
Haley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember specifically having a conversation of this
sort with De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I talked with George De Mohrenschildt about Oswald. I don't
think I talked with him very much, maybe once or twice. Well, I saw Oswald
this one time and, of course, we would see George De Mohrenschildt off and on,
periodically up until the time he left and I received a letter from George every
once in awhile from Haiti so I know him quite well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you received letters from Mr. De Mohrenschildt after
the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Has he said anything in these letters about the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us generally what he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Well, one letter he said he just couldn't believe Oswald did it
and he said he was quite surprised and he said that he had written to Mrs.
Kennedy's mother because apparently George knew Mrs. Auchincloss or whatever
her name is and had known Mrs. Kennedy when she was much younger and
said he had written to her expressing his sorrow about this and that he felt
that Oswald was not the one that did it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he give you any reasons for his feeling that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; he did not and then I received another letter from him and
he just said he still couldn't believe that this had happened&mdash;that Oswald had
done it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you still have copies of those letters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I know I got at least one of them. I may have both of them. I
know I got the last one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I would like you, if you would, you don't have them with you,
of course?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If you would look through your records when you go back to
Fort Worth and if you do have any of those letters, I would appreciate if you
would send them or copies to Mr. Sanders here and I will be back in Dallas
next week and I would like to read the letters and may want to make them
part of this record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did De Mohrenschildt ever say to you in these letters anything
to the effect he thought that the FBI was responsible for the assassination of
President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He never gave you any specific reasons why he did not think
Oswald was the man who did it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; George would be the type person that he is, he would not
believe that anyone he knew would do anything that was out of line. He is an
extremely likeable person and he is quite an adventurer. He walked through
Mexico; he is extremely athletic and he is, well, actually, he should have lived
300 or 400 years ago and been an explorer or pirate or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know how close his association with Oswald was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Well, I understand one time he threatened to beat Oswald to a
pulp if he didn't leave Marina alone, quit beating her up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I forgot; one of the Russian group and I think George told me
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. George De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes; and he indicated to me that he had really given Oswald a
real lashing about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any idea when that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. It's bound to have been in&mdash;sometime after the first of January,
sometime in the spring of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How do you fix that date in your mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Well, I know that the only time that we saw Oswald and Marina
was in October of 1962, before she left for Dallas and I don't think that George
De Mohrenschildt had come in contact with Oswald and Marina much before
that time. I know that when they moved to Dallas, the Oswalds, George
De Mohrenschildt, we would hear, would take Oswald and Marina around or
had them over to his apartment several times and I know that during the
Christmas holidays of 1962 they had a big party, the Russian group had a
party at the Ford's house around the 26th or 27th of December. We were
invited but we were skiing and didn't go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Off record discussion.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. So, getting back to that party&mdash;so we didn't go to the party at
the Fords. I have heard that George De Mohrenschildt is the one that took
the Oswalds to the Ford party and that he saw them off and on after that and
that during that period of time we would hear in Fort Worth that Oswald had
beat Marina up and that she had to run off, and quite a bit of physical violence,
and that George finally got hold of Oswald and threatened him&mdash;picked him up
by his shirt and shook him like a dog and told him he would really work him
over if he ever laid another hand on her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think that was sometime after the Ford party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I feel pretty sure it was. I have nothing to tie it to but I think
it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How often did you see De Mohrenschildt during the period
January 1, 1963, to the time he left for Haiti?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I do not recall exactly when he left for Haiti.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I think it was in May sometime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I know one time during that period I think George went to
Pennsylvania or New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; that's right, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I would say we would see them at least once every 2 or 3 weeks
maybe. He might drop over to the office in Fort Worth on the way through.
I think he did that a couple times and we would either see him at his apartment
or he would come to our house. We saw him once a month or maybe more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember in April 1963, there was an attempt made
on the life of General Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see De Mohrenschildt after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I am sure I did. If he left in May I feel sure I saw him shortly
before he left for Haiti.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recall discussing the attempt on General Walker with
De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; there would be no reason. We seldom discussed or talked
politics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have no recollection that he mentioned Oswald in connection
with the Walker attempt at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. At that time it was the furthest thing because I don't think that
George De Mohrenschildt and I even mentioned Oswald in any of our conversations,
parties or get-togethers at any time unless it was just someone made a
comment about Marina getting beat up about the only comment we had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any question about De Mohrenschildt's loyalty
to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. None; I think he talks a lot and I think he is a character but
I don't think he is disloyal in any respect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would it surprise you to hear that he was of the opinion that
the FBI was responsible for the assassination and that Oswald was just a
"patsy" in the thing?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Knowing George, he's liable to say anything whether he really
believed it or not because he talks very loudly and sometimes without even
thinking; most of the time he does that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form any opinion of Oswald during the time that you
spoke to him and on the basis of things you heard about him as to whether
he was mentally unstable or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. It didn't enter my mind he was mentally unstable. I just thought
he was a person that he couldn't get along with anybody or anyone. He just
seemed to be a person that believed everyone else in the world was out of
step but himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And this is about the only opinion you formed of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Well, I just thought&mdash;I didn't think&mdash;well, I just felt that this
is a guy that just was never going to be able to do anything because he couldn't
get along with anybody and he just, he was&mdash;didn't seem to know what he wanted
to do or what he wanted to have and he was a completely shiftless individual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Never heard of him until all this happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know of any connection between Oswald and Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I wouldn't have any reason of knowing whether he did or did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you don't know of any connection between the two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you surprised when you heard that Oswald had been
arrested in connection with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I was very surprised because it never entered my mind in the
first place and the last we had heard, he was in New Orleans or some place
like that. He had left Dallas. We didn't even know he returned to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think based on your knowledge of Oswald that he was
capable of committing an act such as he was charged to have committed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Definitely; I think he would have done this to President Kennedy
or anyone else if he felt that it would make him infamous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have the feeling that his motivation was simply to call
attention to himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I do. I think it was primarily to go down in history because
he seemed to think he was destined to go down in history some way or other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you now told us everything that you recall about Oswald
and the conversations that you had with him? I don't have any more questions
at the moment but if you can think of anything that you think the Commission
should know or anything you want to add to what you said, go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. It is extremely difficult to remember because there has been so
much printed and so much said so it is hard with 1- or 2-hour conversations
over 2 years ago to remember what was discussed and to separate it from what
you formed an opinion on since then. So, it is extremely difficult to say. I
think I covered everything. At the time when I talked with him I was very
interested in learning what it was like in Russia and I asked many questions
of Oswald primarily concerned with what life was like in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember in any greater detail than you already testified
about these hunting trips or any association with firearms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. The question of firearms did not come up. He just indicated he
and Marina would go out in the fields and walk around. I don't recall whether
he said he went hunting. I am not a hunter; it doesn't interest me a bit. If
he said he was hunting it probably would not have registered on me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He did not indicate any peculiar or strong interest in firearms
to you at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Not at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He never indicated that to you at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; not at any time; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Clark, have you ever engaged in any conversations with
any members of the Russian community or heard of any conversations amongst
them concerning the question of whether or not Oswald might have been a
Russian agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Most of the Russian group were concerned about Oswald and
Marina. It seemed that the older of the Russian group, that is, the ones that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
had lived in the States the longest period of time and couldn't be considered as
"DP's" were less concerned about it than those recent arrivals from Soviet
blocs; the ones that were "DP's" just couldn't understand how the Oswalds got
out of Russia so easily. The older group said well, they figure that they were of
no value to the Russians and they felt it was good riddance and didn't seem to
be concerned about it because they felt the American government was keeping
the proper surveillance on them and knew of their background. They would not
be put in a position where they could do damage so it did not concern the ones
that had been here since the revolution as much as the ones that got out
recently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Most of the opinions of the latter group were based primarily
on the difficulties, I suppose, that they themselves had in getting out of Russia,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes; based on the reason the ones&mdash;because they had considerable
difficulty in getting out of those countries and they felt probably Oswald and
Marina got out too easily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of any particular people, their names, as to this
"DP" group that were suspicious or expressed suspicions because of Oswald's
apparent ease with which he got out of Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Lydia Dymitruk and Alex Kleinlerer, the Mellers, Anna and Teofil
Meller. I think you talked with them. I can't think. I know there's several
others of the younger group that came over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Ray?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Thomas Ray&mdash;her name is Anna Ray, yes; I met them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know a Mr. and Mrs. Frank Ray?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; I don't; I am not sure of the first one; the one I know is the
wife is of Russian origin; her name is Anna.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That's Mrs. Frank Ray.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. That's the one I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know Mr. or Mrs. Thomas Ray; they live in Blossom,
Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; I don't. I might if I were to see them but I don't recall
their name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you yourself have any reason to think that Oswald might be
an agent of the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I didn't think he had the intelligence to be an agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did consider the question prior to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I considered it briefly when he first contacted us when he got back
here and after talking with him, I felt I didn't think that they were that stupid
to use someone that stupid as an agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever tell you that he had been contacted by the
FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I did not discuss it with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never mentioned it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. He never mentioned it. I did not inquire of him. I was keeping it
strictly what life was in Russia. I was trying to stay off political issues or
anything about the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't think I have any more questions. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="t355"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_GEORGE_A_BOUHE" id="TESTIMONY_OF_GEORGE_A_BOUHE">TESTIMONY OF GEORGE A. BOUHE</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of George A. Bouhe was taken at 2 p.m., on March 23, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. Attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Bouhe, before we start I want to tell you that my name is
Wesley J. Liebeler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
I think Mr. Rankin sent you a letter last week telling you that we would be
in touch with you for the purpose of taking your testimony in connection with
your knowledge of Lee Harvey Oswald and his background, and anything you
might know about the assassination or anything shedding light on Oswald's
motive.</p>

<p>I am a member of the legal staff of the Commission, and the Commission has
authorized me to take your deposition pursuant to the power granted to it by
Executive Order 11130 dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution of Congress
No. 137.</p>

<p>I believe we sent you copies of those documents in the letter which you have,
and also we sent you a copy of the Rules of the Commission governing its
proceedings and the taking of testimony.</p>

<p>Now the Secret Service, as I understand, called you on Friday and asked you
to be here this afternoon. You are entitled to 3 days' written notice, and I
suppose that we can say that you have received the notice since you received it on
Friday, but I presume you are prepared to go ahead at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. May I ask this? Is this my appearance before the Commission,
or is it another step in the investigation preliminary to my appearance before
the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. No. This is in effect your appearance before the Commission.
A transcript of our report will be forwarded to the Commission, and it won't
be necessary for you to come to Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. Bouhe, would you stand and raise your right hand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, so help you God, in the testimony you are about to give?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, Mr. Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. George A. Bouhe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. 4740 Homer Street, Dallas 4, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you presently employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I am a semiretired accountant. I do not have a regular job
since about early 1963, but I keep a number of sets of books and prepare tax
returns for many people for whom I was doing that in the last 10 or more
years, in addition to my regular job, which I quit on my own volition after
about 10 years, on or about April 30, of last year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. For whom were you employed up to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. For 9½ years I was employed as a personal accountant of a
very prominent Dallas geologist, and probably capitalist if you want to say
it, Lewis W. MacNaughton, senior chairman of the board of the well-known
geological and engineering firm of DeGolyer &amp; MacNaughton, but I was MacNaughton's
personal employee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where were you born, Mr. Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I was born in what was then St. Petersburg, now Leningrad,
Russia, on February 11 or 24, 1904, and the difference in dates is because we
had the Julian and Gregorian calendar, and I have a baptismal certificate showing
February 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Under the old Russian calendar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That would be February 24 under the present day calendar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us when and how it came that you came to the United
States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. During the years 1920 through 1923 back in Petrograd, Russia,
while I was finishing my high school there, which was called the Gymnasium,
although it had nothing to do with athletics, I was working for the American
Relief Commission as an office boy.</p>

<p>It was an association to which the American Congress allocated, I think,
$100 million for the relief of the starving population of Russia.</p>

<p>The Hon. Herbert Hoover was Chairman of that Commission. He sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
American executives to Russia to set up branch offices in several cities, including
what was then already Petrograd, and I, speaking English, was an
office boy.</p>

<p>When we finished that thing, I got a little letter of thanks which is now
here framed, which is my great pride and joy, in which it says to George
Alexandrovich Bouhe, in gratitude and recognition of his faithful efforts to
assist the American Relief Commission in its efforts to relieve the suffering of
the hungry population in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After you worked for the American Relief Commission, did
that lead to your coming to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. That is correct. My association with some of the supervisors
which were American executives led to numerous discussions with them, including,
the now deceased Prof. Frank Golder of Stanford University, Gen. William
Haskell, who later commanded the National Guard; one of my supervisors
said, "Why don't you come to America?" So after the office closed sometime
in August 1923, more or less, I applied for a passport to leave Russia but
was refused. Then I went across the little river separating Soviet Russia from
Finland in the middle of September at night, and it was cold, and got out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You went into Finland and came to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Through Germany and then to the United States in April 1924.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you eventually become an American citizen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I became an American citizen on or about June 1939.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you continue your education when you came to the United
States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Not regularly and not formally. I was working for 13 years for
what is now the Chase Manhattan Bank, but it had previous mergers. I attended
the American Institute of Banking, and that is all I did there, which is
not much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let me ask you where you learned English, Mr. Bouhe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. At home. At the age of 5 to age of 7, I had a French governess.
At the age of 7 to 9, I had a German governess. At the age of 10 to maybe 11,
I had an English governess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You got your first acquaintance with English through the
English governess, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your formal education in the Soviet Union was confined to the
gymnasium, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. That's correct, which is slightly over the high school here, but
it was what is called classical, namely because they taught us Latin and Greek.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you first come to Dallas?</p>

<p>(Mr. Jenner entered the room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span> (continued). Mr. Bouhe, this is Mr. Jenner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. On July 4, 1939.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you lived in Dallas since that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It's been indicated to me, Mr. Bouhe, that you are regarded as
the leader of a so-called Russian group here in Dallas and the Fort Worth
area, and I would like to have you tell us briefly the nature of that group and
how you came to be the, shall we say, so-called leader or its actual leader?
Let's leave it that way. And particularly, Mr. Bouhe, did there come a time when
you formed a congregation of a Russian church here in Dallas? Would you tell
us about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes; you have just mentioned some flattering remarks which I
appreciate if it is true from the sources which you obtained it, but I would say
that if I am so called, it means simply because of a process of elimination,
because when I came in 1939, there were absolutely only three Russian-speaking
people in Dallas and they were all married people, married to Americans, and
so on.</p>

<p>So I did not, so-to-speak, associate with any Russians that might have come
or gone through Dallas from 1939 to about 1950.</p>

<p>In 1950, approximately, a great avalanche of displaced persons came to Dallas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
from Europe. Among these were probably 30, 40, 50 people, native of what I
would say of various parts of the former Russian Empire.</p>

<p>By that I mean to say that they were not all Russian. They might have been
Estonians, Lithuanians, Poles, Caucasians, Georgians, Armenians, and such,
but we did have one thing in common and not much more, and that was the
language.</p>

<p>It was a sort of constant amazement to me that these people, prayed God, for
years before coming here while still sitting in various camps in Germany&mdash;they
wanted to get to America, and if 1 out of 50 made a 10-cent effort to learn the
English language, I did not find him.</p>

<p>So the problem was to help those people to be self-sufficient, self-sustaining,
and as I earnestly hoped, faithful citizens of their new homeland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You gathered these people together and you formed a church
congregation, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. That's correct. Perhaps not all of the people, because I could not
bring a Mohammedan into the Greek Orthodox Church, but anybody who wanted
to come and worship in the Russian or Slovenian language was welcome.</p>

<p>And as you said, I organized&mdash;well, I did the organization work, really.</p>

<p>The godfather of it all to help us with finances was a very prominent well-known
man who still lives here, Paul M. Raigorodsky.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. These people came together in an effort to help the people who
had just come from Europe and who had difficulty with the English language
become useful members of the community and become self-sufficient?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I might have met the first one and maybe helped him to get a
job or maybe took him by the hand and took him to Crozier Tech to learn
English, because I have the great reliance on that.</p>

<p>Some of them were old or very elderly people. "Why do I have to learn English?
All I want to do is get a job."</p>

<p>Well, maybe so, but I think we should look into the English language, too.
And, of course, it was so long ago, maybe nobody realized or remembers the
Crozier Tech, but I was there frequently, I would say, taking people by the
hand and sticking them there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At the time did you meet a man by the name of George De
Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes; I did, who was then married to his wife number two, if
my information is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That lady's maiden name was Sharples?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. That's right; from the main line in Philadelphia, and a daughter
of a prominent industrialist and oilman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you also meet a gentleman by the name of Ilya A. Mamantov?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I did meet him. I cannot promise the year, but somewhere
around that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did there come a time when you met Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us the circumstances surrounding that event.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I met Lee Harvey Oswald and his wife Marina, if my memory
and records serve me right, at approximately on Saturday, August 25, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. At the home on Dorothy Lane in Fort Worth, Tex., of Mr. and
Mrs. Peter P. Gregory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who else was there at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Mr. and Mrs. Gregory, Lee Oswald, his wife and child, son of
Mr. Gregory who was at that time a student at the University of Oklahoma in
Norman, and Mrs. Anna Meller of Dallas, Tex., who was invited there for that
dinner together with her husband who could not come, so I escorted her with
her husband's permission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was a meeting for dinner, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. It was that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who invited you to the dinner, Mr. Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Mr. Gregory tell you how he came to meet Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Has he told you, in effect, that Oswald came to him at the Fort
Worth Public Library and asked him for a letter attesting to his competence
as a translator or interpreter of the Russian language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Mr. Gregory did tell me, and maybe I am not a hundred percent
accurate, that he met him at the Fort Worth Public Library where, if my information
is correct, Mr. Gregory teaches, I think, a free class of the Russian
language.</p>

<p>Mr. Gregory is a native of Siberia, and I think a graduate of Leland Stanford,
an educated man who could teach the Russian language, and he told me
that one day Lee Harvey Oswald sort of approached him and they exchanged
a few talks.</p>

<p>Then, if I am not mistaken, Lee Harvey Oswald came to Mr. Gregory's office
in the Continental Life Building. He came to his office, and if I understood
correctly, Mr. Gregory gave Lee Harvey Oswald a test to evaluate the calibre
of his knowledge of the Russian language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Mr. Gregory tell you that Lee Oswald asked him, Mr.
Gregory, to help him, Oswald, write a book on his experiences in the Soviet
Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. That I do not recall having heard from Mr. Gregory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you hear it from anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. No other time? Did you subsequently hear it after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes; I heard that from reading the papers, from the testimony
of the public stenographer in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bailey, I think her name is, to whom Oswald came with a $10 bill&mdash;and
that information is from the press&mdash;and started dictating the book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So the only thing you know about Mr. Gregory's supposed help
with Oswald's book is from what you read in the newspapers, is that correct?
About the fact that Gregory was supposed to help Oswald with his book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. If he told me before, I swear I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now at the dinner at Gregory's, did you converse with Lee
Oswald and his wife, Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us, to the best of your recollection, what was
said at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. They were both very shy in the beginning, and to break the ice
I used the age-old method of starting conversation on the subject in which
the other person is interested, and since I was born in St. Petersburg, and according
to newspaper reports and what you hear, Marina spent many, many
years, or was even brought up in St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>This created in me an extraordinary interest to meet that person, for no
particular political reason, but after you are gone from your hometown for
40 some odd years you would like to see if your house is still standing or the
church is broken up, or the school is still in existence, or the herring fish market
still smells.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You discussed those questions with Marina Oswald at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Right. And also I had in my possession a rather large album
of maps published in Moscow and purchased by me through V. Kamkin Book
Store, Washington, D.C., the album being called the "Plans of St. Petersburg"
from the creation by Peter The Great in 1710 to our days, and there were dozens
of maps made at regular intervals, including the last one made under the
Czarist Regime in 1914, which is really what I was interested in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you discussed those maps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I took the map with me and we sat down on the floor and I asked
Marina, if my school here, or that thing there, and just any exchange of
pleasantries on that subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina tell you that she subsequently left Leningrad and
moved to Minsk?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you why, either at this time or any other time?
Did you learn from Marina why she moved from Leningrad, from St. Petersburg
to Minsk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. To the best of my knowledge, I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss at that time Oswald's trip to the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Let me ask you this, Mr. Bouhe. Did you discuss&mdash;let's not just limit your
discussion in this regard to the first meeting, but looking back over your entire
knowledge of Oswald, when I ask you these questions as to what you discussed
at these meetings with him, and let's cover your discussions with Oswald and
your knowledge of his background, and we will go back and pick up the other
times when you met him.</p>

<p>Let me ask you if you at this time or subsequent meetings discussed with
Oswald the reasons for him going to the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I did not at that meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you subsequently discuss with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I did not discuss it because I know I will antagonize him, and
I could get a conclusion of my own, right or wrong, and my conclusion on that
is that he is, if I may so call him, a rebel against society.</p>

<p>Meaning, even if it is good, "I don't like it." That conclusion came into my
head after maybe a few weeks, and after I first met him, because I got dizzy
following his movements. Either he goes into the Marines, voluntarily apparently,
then he quits. That is no good. He goes into the football team in
his high school, and he quits. He doesn't like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Not about a football team, but in the Marines he said he didn't
like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you learn about the football?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. In the press after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let's confine your conversations just to what you learned from
him or what you inferred yourself from observing Oswald.</p>

<p>Let me ask you specifically if Oswald ever discussed with you the job that he
had while he was in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Only I could pull out fragmentary information, and frankly I
didn't press him because he was sort of reluctant to talk. I don't remember
what he really said, except that he worked in a sheet metal factory.</p>

<p>But what I was interested and asked frequently is, what is the economic
aspect and the social aspect of life of a man like he in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ask him how much he was paid for his work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Well, he certainly did tell me, and I think he said 90 rubles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you that that was all the income that he had while
he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. That was all he said, and he even went further when I asked
him, "Well, out of that, what do you have to pay out?"</p>

<p>Well, he says, "The rent was free." So he didn't pay for the rent.</p>

<p>I said, "What did you get as rent?"</p>

<p>"Well, it was an old factory building."</p>

<p>I don't know what he called old, or if it was a big room separated by a flimsy
partition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is the place where he lived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have a feeling, or did he tell you, did he have quarters
similar to the ordinary Russian people who have similar jobs, or did he appear
to have better quarters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. That I did not ask him. But I wanted to go through 90 rubles,
if that was the figure, and see what you can get, and so he comes out, that I
remember, and brings me a pair of shoes or boots which he bought, cracked-up
leather uppers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Pretty sad pair of boots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Pretty sad pair of boots here, and the tops&mdash;which were famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
for Russian boots for generations, which were originally all leather and protected
you against the wintry blasts, rain and so on&mdash;were now of duck or canvas
painted black. Well, from a distance, it looked like a pair of high leather boots,
but they were awful, and even he, in a strange moment said, "They are no
good."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you how much they cost?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. If I am not mistaken, 19 rubles, but I would not swear to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you continue those discussions and have him go through
the entire 90 rubles as to what he spent it on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. That very same evening I noticed that he didn't like to talk
about it, but since he was in a nice home maybe he was polite on one of his
rare occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This conversation all took place at the home of Peter Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. In the home of Mr. Gregory. I asked him, "Now 90 rubles you
got. Rent is free. Boots are 19 rubles&mdash;and I can't imagine what it is in
Minsk when it rains&mdash;what about the food?"</p>

<p>And that figure I remember distinctly.</p>

<p>In the cafeteria or whatever that was where the laborers eat, it cost him,
he said, 45 rubles a month to eat. So 19 and 45, and just to mention a couple
of items, I didn't go any further because either he was lying or else he was
going without shoes and coats or something because there was not enough money
left to buy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ask him whether the 90 rubles of which he spoke
was all the money he received while he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I did not ask that question; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But it appeared to you from this discussion that he must have
received more or else he was going without certain items, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Well, it would so appear, but I could not ask him. I said, "90
minus 45, minus 19, what is left?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>But I could not press him because it was a social gathering and I couldn't
cross-examine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never discussed that question with him subsequently, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Not his budget. I did discuss the cost of other items. For
instance, he had a portable radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes; I did. Most awful production. He also had a Gramophone
and records.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ask him how much the radio cost?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. If I did, I don't remember. I probably did, but I honestly don't
remember. But it was a small one. I had somebody to look at it and he said
it is a most awful construction.</p>

<p>But anyway, I also saw a pair of shoes of Marina's which she bought there,
and I would say they were not worth much as far as the wearing qualities
are concerned, but how much they paid for it, I don't know. And what she
was earning, I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss with Oswald his membership in a hunting
club in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I never discussed a membership in any organization or hunting
club. But I now remember that when I asked him after the week's work is
done, what do you do&mdash;"Well, the boys and I go and hunt duck."</p>

<p>And he said, "ducklings". The reason why I remember it is because he didn't
say "duck," but he said in Russian the equivalent of "duckys-duckys".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He used the Russian word that was not the precise word to
describe duck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes; but a man going shooting would not use it. He spoke in
Russian and did not try to get the Russian word exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you how many times he went hunting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you whether he owned a gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. There?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you whether he had to pay any charges in connection
with his hunting trips?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No; never asked. Was never told.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald tell you anything about the details of his trip to
indicate that he actually had gone hunting, that you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you believe him when he told you he had gone hunting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I thought of him as a simpleton, but at that time I had no reason
to suspect his lying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now as far as you knew, he did actually go hunting when he
was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. That is what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That didn't surprise you at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No; that is one of the occupations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did he ever discuss with you his relation with the Soviet
Government, how he got along with them and what he thought of the Soviet
Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I have never asked him. He never volunteered it. And much
as I'd like to assist you further, I swear again I never discussed or heard him
volunteer any such thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you why he decided to come back from Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. He did say once, and I hate to talk about a dead man, what I
thought shedding a crocodile tear, "It would be good for my daughter to be
brought up in the United States."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that the only reason that he ever told you about why he
wanted to come back to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Substantially. I cannot think of anything else besides the fact
that most of us who spoke with him have an impression, and the Russian
people are very subject to easy impressions, is that Marina was hell-bent to
go out of the Soviet Union and into America.</p>

<p>And I think one of the ladies said "Why," and I remember through third hand
a report reached me, "I always wanted to have a room of my own."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember who told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Mrs. Anna Meller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you get the impression that Marina married Oswald just
to get out of the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I cannot say that that was the only reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think it was one of the reasons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. She was saying Marina wanted to come to America.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you gathered the impression that that was one of the
reasons why Marina married Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Only after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, did you gain an impression as to whether Marina wanted
to marry Oswald, that that was one of the reasons why she married Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. That is my impression. My impression. But I wasn't there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't remember anyone telling you that that was one of
the reasons? That is to say, neither Marina or Oswald told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Certainly not Oswald. But just a minute, much as I'd like to
say, I do not recall a direct statement to that effect, but Marina liked to look
at magazines, she said, and Cadillacs and iceboxes and this and that, and from
what I understood her talk, she was just itching to get in on that. Now that is
my impression, and God strike me if I say something wrong about her, but that
is my impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald tell you that he traveled inside the Soviet Union
while he was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I do not recall any mention or conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever tell you that he had gone to Moscow on two or
three different occasions from Minsk?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Well, I don't know what the occasions were or the number of
them, but he certainly must have gone to apply at the American Embassy in
Moscow at some period of time to return.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But he didn't tell you that, as far as you can recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald mention that he had received any training while
he was in the Soviet Union? That he had gone to school or received any special
train from the Soviet Government of any kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I do not recall anything, any statement by him on that subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you that he had been in the hospital while he was
in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you speak to Oswald in the Russian language from time
to time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form an impression as to his command of that language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was that impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. A very strange assortment of words. Grammatically not perfect,
but an apparent ease to express himself in that language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know when you knew Oswald how long he had been
in the Soviet Union, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. That I knew from a clipping which I have at home, from the Fort
Worth newspaper, yes, which first brought the name of Oswald before my eyes
sometime in June 1962. And that story said the Fort Worth boy returns after
so many years, and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald's command of the Russian language seem to be about
what you would expect from him, having been in Russia for that period of time?
Would you say it was good?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I would say very good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You think he had a good command of the language, considering
the amount of time he had spent in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Sir, for everyday conversations, yes. But I think that if I would
have asked him to write, I would think he would have difficulty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you get the impression that he received any special
training in the Russian language while he was in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Never heard of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did not get that impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I did not get it, but back in the old country, in the good old days
in St. Petersburg, which was cosmopolitan, everybody spoke French&mdash;well,
some from in school and some from governesses and some from trips to Paris,
and that is supposed to be the best way to learn the language, so I would say
from my estimate of the caliber of his language is that he picked it up by ear
from Marina, other girls, or from factory workers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You also conversed with Marina in Russian, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Oh, yes; she is very good, I must say, to my great amazement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Much better than Oswald? Was Marina's command of the
Russian language better than what you would have expected, based on her
education?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever ask her how she came to have such a good command
of the language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Well, I did not ask her in the form of a question. I complimented
her, because most of the displaced persons whom we met here who went through
wars and mixtures and Germany and French speak a very, very broken unpolished
Russian, which I tried to perfect.</p>

<p>And I complimented her on that. You are speaking in amazingly grammatical&mdash;maybe
I said, I don't know&mdash;correct language.</p>

<p>And she said, "My grandmother who raised me&mdash;I don't know what period&mdash;she
was an educated woman. She went to&mdash;and she gave me a school for noble
girls." Something like, I don't know&mdash;are you a Dallas man&mdash;perhaps Bryn
Mawr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Some prominent school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes. The grandmother was a graduate, and she gave me the
name, which is a top school. And when you come out of that school as a young
girl, you are polished&mdash;Smolny Institute for Noble Girls.</p>

<p>And also, Marina said, that the contact with her grandmother influenced her
a little bit on the study of religion. And whether she believes or does not, I do
not know, but she was not an agnostic, in her words. What is in her soul,
I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form an impression as to the girl's character of Marina
Oswald throughout the time that you knew her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What do you think of her general character? Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Let me ask you to confine your answer first, Mr. Bouhe, to the judgments
about Marina that you had formed prior to the time of the assassination, and
then I will ask you if you changed those judgments or amplified them after
the event of the assassination.</p>

<p>But first of all, tell us your general impression of Marina Oswald as you
thought of her prior to November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. All right, and essentially what I will say is prior to about December
28, 1962, because I have not met any of them since.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that she was a lost soul, as I understood without investigating
the girl, no papa, no mama, no home, I don't know who they were,
brought up by probably an old grandmother, born perhaps at the time of the
greatest holocaust that existed there from 1941, 1942, and 1943, when Leningrad
was surrounded by Germans and there was a great deal of privation, hunger, and,
I heard, even cannibalism.</p>

<p>Maybe she was thinking that this is an awful place and she would have to
do whatever she could to get out.</p>

<p>Maybe she was partly influenced by her grandmother who, I would say, is
of the old school, but I don't know.</p>

<p>And I think she must have been looking for that opportunity which presented
itself in Minsk.</p>

<p>So I think she is a very thinking person, but what her ultimate goal was
or is, I cannot guess even now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you tell the FBI that you thought Marina was a product
of the Soviet machine and that all initiative had been removed from her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I certainly don't remember if I said that, those specific words,
but that is what I believe. If you are educated by the Soviet regime, in their
schools, I think you don't think anything of your own, which is substantially
what I said, isn't it, or is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; she had had all initiative removed from her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Except a romantic initiative to get a man and do something
about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did you change your opinion or did you expand your
opinion of Marina Oswald upon reflection after the assassination occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I could only add that I probably think her a person of exceedingly
strong character to go through that very sad set of events without going berserk.
She has a character. Now whether it is directed in the right thing or not,
I don't know. I want to say, I think she is good material to become a useful
citizen, but to figure out a woman, I do not volunteer as an expert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During the period in October and November of 1962, when,
as I recall it, Marina and Lee Oswald were having a certain amount of marital
trouble or difficulties, did you say that you gained Marina's confidence about
those matters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Not I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She didn't tell you about her marital difficulties with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No; she talked to other people who told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who were these other women?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Well, certainly to Anna Meller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mrs. Ford?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Mrs. Ford, undoubtedly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think she confided in Anna Ray to any extent?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Could have, although I was not present, but they had long
sessions together, just girls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You spoke about these parties with Mrs. Ford and Anna Meller
and Anna Ray.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Well, the only time I have been bringing that up is when I saw
or heard that she had a black eye.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you see that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I would say within the first 2 weeks of September. One Saturday
several of us arrived at their house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At Oswald's house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where was that house located at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. On Mercedes Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes; and she had a black eye. And not thinking about anything
unfortunate, I said: "Well, did you run into a bathroom door?" Marina said,
"Oh, no, he hit me."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was Oswald there at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina tell you the details of her argument with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No; maybe the dinner wasn't ready or this wasn't or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She didn't tell you the details though at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You said that you noticed another black eye. Did you see
Marina with bruises on her at a time prior to this time in September?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When was that? Did she appear bruised at Mr. Gregory's
party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Oh, no; that was when she ran away from Oswald, probably in
the middle of November, already in Oak Cliff here in Dallas. She called at 11
o'clock at night Mrs. Anna Meller from a gasoline station and said, "He is
beating me up and here I am with the baby and no diaper and no nothing,
and so on, what can I do?"</p>

<p>Well, if you talk to Mrs. Anna Meller, you will see that she is a plain,
very attractive woman with a big heart, and what could she say but "come over."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mrs. Meller told Marina to come over to her house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Right. That was 11 o'clock at night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Marina went to Mrs. Meller's and stayed there about a week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. About a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And subsequently she went to Mrs. Ford's house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you took her there to Mrs. Ford?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I did take her, with the baby and the playpen, and Mrs. Anna
Meller drove over with us to Mrs. Katya Ford's, I think, on a Saturday or
Sunday, because Mrs. Ford volunteered that since the Meller's had a very
small apartment, to take Marina for a week because her husband, Declan P.
Ford, was attending the American Association of Petroleum Geologists Convention
in Houston for the whole week and she could bring her over for a
week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was in November of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I would say October, but I would not swear. Do you know it is
November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes, it was November 11 to 18, 1962, according to Mrs. Ford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Well then, it was, if Mrs. Ford said so, and the only double check
I can make is to check, when was the American Association of Petroleum
Geologists Convention in Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't know, but that is a matter that Mrs. Ford can testify.
Your recollection was, it would have been in October, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes; because they moved from&mdash;she is probably right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let's go into that just a little bit. When, according to your
recollection, did Oswald move from Fort Worth to Dallas?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. All right; I would say on or about&mdash;that is Oswald&mdash;October 7,
1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald talk to you at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he say? What were the circumstances of that conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Well, we were at their house at the end of September or first days
of October. Maybe it was&mdash;in other words, a few of us were at the house of
Oswald on an afternoon. I presume it must have been a Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who was there, Mr. Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. It was probably Mrs. Anna Meller, myself, possibly Mrs. Hall
in fact I know&mdash;Mrs. Elena Hall of Fort Worth, because I remember distinctly
that Lee Oswald came home and said his job had ended, wherever he was
working at in Fort Worth, and no prospects for another job existed.</p>

<p>The rent was already a few days past due and they had to do something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald tell you he had been fired from his job in Fort
Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No. He said it was a temporary job anyway. That he did say.
Firing, I never heard. So at that time Mrs. Hall&mdash;that Russian lady&mdash;said,
"My husband is away. Marina, you move over to my house with the kid,
and he goes to Dallas to look for a job."</p>

<p>For some reason, I would say it must have been around October 6 or 7. That
would be my guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you help Oswald find a job in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I was a little bit already cautious because his conversation with
me was always very abrupt and he never looked me in the eye. And to me,
this is a criterion that we don't see eye to eye, I guess. And I said, the only
way to start here is go to the Texas Employment Commission, which he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you that he had been there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any other way of knowing that he was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I think we asked a lady we knew there&mdash;not I, because I didn't
know her well enough&mdash;to help him if she could to get him a job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who asked her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Mr. Teofil Meller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember the lady's name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Mrs. Cunningham.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Mr. Meller tell you that he had talked to Mrs. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. He told Mrs. Cunningham&mdash;he is a Ph. D., a very kind man&mdash;he
said he didn't know the man from Adam, but he has a wife and a little baby,
and if he can get a job it would help the family to get on their feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you learn that Oswald subsequently did obtain a job in
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes, I did. And as a person who at that time suspected nothing
except that I had a desire if I could, to put him on his feet economically so he
could support his wife and child&mdash;I said, now those were my words, "Lee, you've
now got a job, a lithographic job at a $1.45 an hour as an apprentice. If you
apply yourself"&mdash;those were my very words&mdash;"in a couple years you'll have a
skill that can be saleable any place."</p>

<p>And he said, "You think so." And he didn't even say thank you.</p>

<p>Then I added, "Well, I would like to hear how you get along," which is a
standard statement I would ask anybody.</p>

<p>And for 2 or 3&mdash;or possibly 5 days thereafter he would call me at 6 o'clock, I
guess when he finished his work, and say, "I am doing fine. Bye."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That would be the extent of his conversation with you on the
telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He didn't tell you anything of the details of his work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I did not ask.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know <span class="locked">where&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Wait a second, maybe I did ask and, well, he said it was some
photographic process in the lithographic business, but I don't know what that
means.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know where Oswald lived when he moved to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. YMCA on Ervay Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know how long he lived there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I certainly would be willing to bet that he lived there from about
October the 7th or 8th, I am sorry, about October 8, which is a Monday, until
about October 18. But that latter figure I do not know myself except from an
FBI agent who told me he checked out on the 18th, but that I do know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know where he moved when he checked out of the
YMCA?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. At some point thereabouts he threw at me when I asked, "Where
do you live now?" He gave me, if I recall correctly, a name of the Carlton boarding
house on Madison Avenue, but it proved to be wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you tell the FBI that he told you he lived at the Carlton
boarding house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The FBI checked it out and told you subsequently that he had
not lived there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. That's correct. The FBI men went there, and it developed that
Oswald told me a lie to send me on a wild goose chase, but the name strikes
me somehow; and FBI rechecked this place and said it was a bum steer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As far as you know, the next place that Oswald lived after he
moved out of the YMCA was in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Madison is around the corner from somewhere he ultimately
lived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He ultimately lived at 604 Elsbeth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. And on my card I have a date of November the 2d, 1962, that he
found this apartment and moved there, but that I heard from others because
by that time I lost all communication with them; didn't talk to him; didn't ask
him anything, and he didn't call me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That would have been in November 1962, would it not, Mr.
Bouhe, that he moved to the apartment you are speaking of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes; and I would say that is pretty good because I think the
FBI agent told me they proved that, or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever visit the Oswald apartment at Elsbeth Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever visit their apartment at No. 215 Neely Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Never even knew where it was. Never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At any time after November 1 and prior to December 28, 1962,
did you see or talk to Oswald? December 28 is the date of the Ford party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. From November 1 to December 28?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I would say that by some unanticipated chance I might have
run into him and her or both at the De Mohrenschildt's, but I wouldn't swear.
Let me add that certainly no communication was maintained on my part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see Marina during that period of time, however?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Once or twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have already testified that you moved her from Anna
Meller's to the Ford's house, and that would have been in November of 1962,
would it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Oh, yes; that is right. That is right.</p>

<p>Then maybe I said something that I shouldn't have said. In November I
told they moved to Elsbeth. Then a week later she ran to Anna Meller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You previously testified that you thought that Marina had
lived with the Ford's during October, but now it is a fact, is it not, that when
Marina moved to the Fords and when she moved to stay with Anna Meller,
she moved from the apartment in Oak Cliff, did she not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It must have been November because your recollection is she
didn't move to the Oak Cliff area until November, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes. That is a slip of the tongue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see Marina during the month of November 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I don't remember seeing her during that period of time except in
moving her from Mellers to Fords. If I ran into him or her once at the De
Mohrenschildt's, that is the maximum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't see him at anytime when you saw Marina when
she was moving from the Mellers to the Fords?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He wasn't around at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. A few minutes ago I asked you about your judgment of Marina
Oswald's character and we had an off-the-record discussion. Would you repeat
for us that discussion, the statement you made off the record at that time, and
recapitulate for us your thoughts on Marina Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I think she is a well brought up girl. By that I mean, from my
calculation, that she had received a good care from some old person of the
old regime. Religious, well mannered, and such.</p>

<p>She liked glitter, fun, maybe, just like any young pretty girl of that age
would, probably, but I think she was also a driver and ambitious about it.
Even by looking at her, I would say that in the small size you would not think
she would.</p>

<p>And it seems to me that she followed that line by meeting Oswald, coaxing
him to come to America, and so as, she told me herself, she could write a postal
card to her old girl friends "watch me sail to America."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned in your off-the-record discussion that you had
thought to yourself isn't it possible that Marina is a great actress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. There again she acts so natural that I was disarmed. But at
this stage of the game, maybe I was a fool.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why do you say that, Mr. Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Maybe she is a superagent of some organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any reason to think that prior to the time of the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Certainly not. Never entered into my head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But it has entered into your head since the assassination, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Well, after that, you think of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But there was nothing about Marina's behavior as you observed
it prior to the assassination that led you to think that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Positively nothing. But we did in the Russian colony have conversations.
We were repeatedly amazed at the ease with which Marina left the
U.S.S.R., which we, who know the setup on the other side, is almost incredible.</p>

<p>American, British, and other diplomats married Russian girls and it took
them years to get their wives out. And at one moment I did ask, I think, both
of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Asked who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Both of them Lee and Marina. "Well, it is certainly unusual
that they let you out. How did you do it?"</p>

<p>It was a completely innocent question at that time.</p>

<p>"Well, we just went to the right office."</p>

<p>And they in the office said, "All right, take it away," or something to that
effect in Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now did you have any discussions with other friends of yours
here in Dallas as to whether or not Oswald was possibly an agent of the U.S.S.R.?
And I want you to confine your answer to the time prior to the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. The majority of our Russian background colony having suffered
very much under the Soviet and Hitler rule, even after 10 and 12 or more years
of good peace and comparative prosperity in this country, are still constantly
on the suspicion of anything that comes from Russia.</p>

<p>Many of them shook heads, saying, well, I don't know, maybe he is a Soviet
spy. At least I came to a conclusion, right or wrong, that the man came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
the American Embassy in Moscow asking for the permit to return to his native
land. It took 2 years of something to process that application. To me, these
2 years meant that probably it is not only paperwork between the Moscow
Embassy and Russia, but probably some investigation.</p>

<p>Therefore, I felt that whatever investigating agency of the United States,
whether it is Secret Service, CIA, or anybody else concerned with repatriation
with such a suspicious character, took their good little time of 2 years to
process his return back to the United States. That processed his right to bring
his wife and also gave them 400 some odd dollars to come here because they
didn't have any money.</p>

<p>At this point I want to state that when Mr. Gregory invited me to dinner
the first time, I checked with Mr. Max Clark as an attorney friend to the effect
that is this a sort of a cloudy deal, and I am sticking my neck out in my meeting
the person? And after a couple of days, I don't remember exactly Mr. Clark's
answer, but there were words to the effect that since he was processed through
the proper channels, apparently there is nothing wrong, but you have to be
careful. I think these were the words. Then I accepted the invitation for
dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now did other members of the Russian colony express to you
the thought that Oswald might have been a Russian agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I would say, based on pure emotions and bred-in suspicions, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell me who expressed those thoughts to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Well, I don't know who said that, but I really don't remember
who said that, because there was so much talk. But probably it was mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't remember specifically who mentioned it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I wish I knew, and if I think, I will tell you, but I don't. And
I am not hiding anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You attended a party at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Declan P.
Ford on December 28, 1962, did you not? And Mr. and Mrs. Oswald were
there, were they not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Right; uninvited.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. De Mohrenschildt was there, was he not, and his wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any discussion at that party on the question of
whether or not Oswald was or could be a Russian agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. That party is very vivid in my memory. All of a sudden toward
late in the evening appeared George De Mohrenschildt and his wife, accompanied
by Oswald and Marina. I could almost hear a gasp among some of the
people who were around me. I can almost for certain say that during that
evening until the De Mohrenschildt's took him back home, if I got a human
hello from Oswald, that was the extent of my conversation, and I exchanged
maybe half a dozen words with Marina who said, "Nice to see you again." I
would say that would be the extent of that conversation.</p>

<p>At that party we were especially astounded that after having a couple of
drinks and without seeing Oswald talk extensively to anybody except maybe
circulate from one to another, he spotted a Japanese girl. And if I recall
correctly, any time I would look any place, he was with her.</p>

<p>Marina circulated a little bit, ate very heartily, and everybody, so to speak,
commented that such a little girl had so many helpings, apparently she didn't
have very many good things to eat before.</p>

<p>Then toward midnight there was a little singing with a guitar, you know,
Russians like to sing, piano and guitar, three or four voices. Oswald, I remember,
looked from the doorway, did not come. Marina came finally feeling
better, came and stood around for a moment or two. "Nice it is here," she
said, and that was the end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After the Oswalds left, did any of the people at the party
discuss the question of whether or not Oswald might have been an agent of the
U.S.S.R.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No, sir; but I do know that one or two men with whom Oswald
spoke, or at least one man, got up in a hurry, and I heard him say clearly, "My
God, what an idiot that is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who was that man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Lev Aronson, chief first cello, Dallas Symphony Orchestra.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Mr. Aronson speak to Oswald? Is that why he thought
Oswald was an idiot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I am not a buddy-buddy of his.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you didn't hear why Aronson thought Oswald was an idiot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After the party at the Fords, there was a get-together at the
Mellers residence sometime before that weekend. Were you present at that
party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Not with Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I didn't say Oswald was there. But there was a group of
people who got together at the Mellers either the next day or the day after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I do not recall that. But they are my close friends of a long
time and I am almost sure I must have been there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any discussion at that party about the question
of whether or not Oswald might be a Russian agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There was also an open-house at your own apartment during
that period of time, was there not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I think there were occasional parties. No discussions about
Oswald being a Russian agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At any time during the period December 28 for the next few
days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. To the best of my recollection, as far as I am concerned, well,
whether others talked, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you didn't hear anybody talking about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Not to my hearing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember saying that Oswald was essentially a mental
case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Well, in the words of Mr. Aronson, I would say that mental
case, that means he is crazy. That is what I meant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember using those words at any time during the
period December 28 and the few days following that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. That I do not remember, but there is a good Russian word when
you act crazy, we say, "My God, you are crazy." But that I do not remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember suggesting to Oswald that he attend some
school and study to attempt to improve his ability?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. That was most probably the first week of October when he
moved here, October 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember what he said to you in response?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes. "What kind of school do they have?"</p>

<p>And I said, "Crozier Evening Technical School, which is a Dallas Board of
Education deal, has 50 subjects for grown-ups to improve their skill, whether
it is academic things, languages, or whether you want to make lampshades."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether Oswald ever went to Crozier Tech?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I do not. He did not tell me anything, but a Secret Service
agent from Los Angeles called me and asked what school could he have gone
to, and I said we have only one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was Crozier Tech?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. That is called Dallas Evening Public School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever see any periodicals or similar literature or magazines
that Oswald subscribed to in his apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. American or Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Of any nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Certainly I saw a lot of Russian magazines, but whether or not
he subscribed or bought occasionally or somebody sent them, I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember the names of any of them? Let me ask you
was "Agitator" one of them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Never saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How about "Crocodile"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Unfortunately; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember the name of any others?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes; I think it is called "O-g-o-n-e-k." Means, "little fire."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any other Russian periodicals that you saw
in Oswald's possession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Something about the sports, because you always could see a Russian
magazine open there with pictures on life in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether he subscribed or regularly read a periodical
called "The Worker"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Never saw a copy in the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How about "The Militant"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Never saw any such article, magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever have occasion to notice any books on political
subjects in Oswald's home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Oswald had a little table in his apartment on Mercedes Street in
Fort Worth. I cannot remember the exact names, but certainly Karl Marx, Lenin
and his works, and similar things which I do not remember. And I positively,
being aghast at such an assortment, flipped over the first two-three pages, and
I think in two out of three I saw the stamp of the Fort Worth Public Library.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss with Oswald the fact that these books
were in his apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever say anything to you about them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss politics with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. American politics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; politics of any kind, or economics? That is, his attitude
toward the U.S. Government and toward the Russian government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. After the first or second visit I saw he was a mixed-up man. I
did not touch any of these subjects.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss them with him during the first two or three
times that you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. The only thing I discussed the first two or three times I saw him
was pure consumer economics for a person living in the Soviet Union, meaning
how much are the shoes and how much is Kleenex and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't discuss subjects like the social system or the economic
system of the U.S.S.R.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I knew he was stuck on it and knew I wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And how did you know he was stuck on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. He was always smirking and occasionally dropping remarks, "Well,
with us in the Soviet Union," meaning some preference, whether it is free rent
or free medical care.</p>

<p>For instance, he said, "Marina had a bad tooth, so we went to some place in
Moscow waiting for the visa, and they took the tooth out but they didn't put
another one in." He said, "We didn't have time." Whether that is right or
wrong, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever indicate that he wanted to return to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Not during the time I knew him; positively not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever ask him in words or substance if he thought Russia
was so good, why didn't he go back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No; I didn't, because I think he began to hate me very early.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why do you say that, Mr. Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I had made well in the United States by sheer work. I have
enough to live nicely and help others if I wish.</p>

<p>The sense of charity is very deep in me. Marina and the child, the latter
sleeping on the floor, attracted me very much. As I repeated to the FBI and
Secret Service many times, while they were not relatives of mine, I still felt
that if I enjoy a good automobile and a good meal and if I know around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
corner somebody's kid is sleeping on the floor, I will not digest that dinner so
very good.</p>

<p>So being endowed with what I thought was boundless energy, when I saw
the situation, I thought I would make an effort the first time to put them on
their feet. I always thought that communism breeds among the down and out
and the dissatisfied people. I certainly felt badly that there were no groceries
in their icebox and the kid was sleeping on the floor and all that.</p>

<p>I thought that by, so to speak, putting a little meat on his bones, lift the
kid into bed, buy a little clothes for the kid, meanwhile assembling from
all of the ladies some clothes for Marina, who was in rags, I thought I will
make him less bitter which he was, and he will see, as I told him, that it
can be done here if you apply yourself. And I added to him, "Lee, I am
exceedingly uneasy from being a foreigner by birth, telling you, a native-born
American, that you can lift yourself by your own boot strap here and live a
decent life because the opportunities are here if you just only take advantage of
them."</p>

<p>Well, his handicap was, he never had any skill. That is true. Marines, no
skill. Sheet-metal work, I don't know if that was true in Russia. He didn't
know anything. I understood from other people that when he went to the Texas
Employment Commission in Fort Worth to ask for a job and they said what
can you do&mdash;nothing. Where did you work last&mdash;Minsk. Let's call it off. He
couldn't progress. He couldn't get any place. So this is maybe facetious on
my part and I admit it, but my policy in this thing was substantially the policy
of the U.S. Government as I see it.</p>

<p>When we see that the Cambodians are leaning towards communism because
they are barefooted, we'll rush in with all kinds of food, groceries, and rehabilitation
equipment to see if they can get on their feet. I did exactly that,
as I saw it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald seem to appreciate your efforts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No; he passed a remark shortly after the second or third visit
to their house when the ladies and I brought the clothes to Marina and such&mdash;I
even brought two shirts for him&mdash;not new, used, and that is where I saw
him for the first time trying to show his displeasure over me.</p>

<p>He measured and he remeasured the shirts so many times, and those were
not new shirts. Finally I said, "Lee, this is to go-to-work. Wear them 3 or 4
days, get them dirty, then throw them away." So finally he folded it up
and gave it back to me. "I don't need any."</p>

<p>Then I understand he objected that myself and a couple of others brought
groceries to the kid and something for them when the icebox was empty. I
took him and Marina once to a supermarket, partly for the groceries and partly
for an educational purpose to explain that this is Ajax and this is Kleenex and
this is the economy size, and this is junior size, and how much per ounce,
just to open her eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you buy groceries for the Oswalds at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember how much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Ten dollars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Could you tell us approximately how much you spent on the
Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. $75. You can make a list, if you wish, because I want to tell
you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Probably groceries, $10. I gave him a $5 bill for the bus fare from
Fort Worth to Dallas on some subsequent Sunday.</p>

<p>I did not know the exact amount of the fare. And when he arrived here and
I met him I said, "Was that enough?" He said, "Oh, yes." But he didn't give
me any change. I remember that.</p>

<p>Then I bought at Montgomery Ward a playpen for about $11 for the kid.
I bought a pair of moccasins for Marina, in the presence of another lady, at
Montgomery Wards for $5, and since she was without stockings, we had to run
and get a pair of stockings because they wouldn't let her measure moccasins
without stockings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
I also gave De Mohrenschildt $20 and I got back $3 or $4 for them to take
Marina to the Baylor School of Dentistry right here in Dallas where students
of the senior class practice on people who cannot afford to go to the regular
dentist.</p>

<p>And since De Mohrenschildt had a lot of time and his wife had a lot of time,
they were taking Marina there probably two or three times. And I think
De Mohrenschildt gave me a couple of dollars back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember if De Mohrenschildt spent any money on
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What about any others, as far as you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. In cash, I do not recall anybody, but in groceries, in clothes, used,
not new, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who else gave such things to the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Through me, I collected&mdash;Mrs. Meller gave, I am sure Mrs. Ford
gave, I can't remember now; possibly Mrs. Hall. Those were used clothes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This all took place prior to the time Oswald moved to Dallas,
did it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. The clothing and grocery contributions, yes, and the dentist, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say the dental work was done after Oswald moved to
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. After, because she was living then with Mrs. Hall in Fort Worth
3 weeks. That means the period somewhere between October 8th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Until November 2d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. That sounds right to me. And during that period she came, I'd
say, once or twice or maybe three times. She had a lot of teeth rotted to the
roots, and feeding the baby, we thought it was very bad, and here those student
guys just love to pull.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did these groceries that you speak of other people giving the
Oswalds, was that in addition to the groceries you purchased for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Probably if we go there, somebody will bring something, I don't
remember. No regular contributions of groceries, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you pay Oswald's rent at the YMCA when he stayed there
in October?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of any other financial contribution that might
have been made to the Oswalds during this period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Well, let's say $20. I would say that is all, $75, more or less.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss with Oswald his service in the Marine
Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he tell you about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. When he was applying for a job, we picked up some kind of
application blanks some place and you have to say about your military service.
And where it says, "Discharged." I'd ask, "How?" And he would say: "Put
down honorable."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was the entire extent of your discussion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Right. He would freeze up like a clam.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever discuss anything about Cuba with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Never heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever see any literature concerning Cuba in his possession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Do not recall having seen anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did either Oswald or Marina ever tell you whether or not
Oswald was personally liked while he was in the Soviet Union? Did he get
along with the Russian people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. This is talking about the lady, so I want to be careful. Marina
said: "When I saw him, I was so sorry for him. Nobody liked him. I was so
sorry for him I must make him comfortable here, or something like that."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is what Marina said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was her reaction to him when she met him in Russia?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember anything else about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. He said he went duck shooting with the boys. But whether they
spoke during shooting, or just were shooting, I don't know. He was not a very
talkative person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have the impression that as a general manner he was not
a popular person when he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. It was my impression for more than one reason. He had a mind
of his own, and I think it was a diseased one. I could not imagine with whom
he would be friendly. I could not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why do you say you thought he had a diseased mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. He changed so much, from an American, to Russia, and back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He never seemed to be satisfied with anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Precisely. Besides, not satisfied with any place. That is the
point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now did Oswald ever express any resentment of the U.S. Government
for delaying his return to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. In a casual remark, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Well, "Damn it, I don't know why it took them so long to get
on the horse."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. "Damn them, I don't know why it took them so long."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is all he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. All I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever express any hostilities toward any individual in
the Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Never heard. And I must emphasize again that to talk politics
with a man like that, I would find totally hopeless and useless. I never did it.
But if anybody asked me, did he have any hostility against anybody in the
Government, which I didn't hear myself, I would say Governor Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why do you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Because, where, I can't find the paper, but when he was in
Minsk, he wrote a letter. I have it some place, but I don't know where, in the
paper here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let me ask you this, Mr. Bouhe. Did Oswald tell you that he
wrote a letter to Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You learned that only after reading it in the paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Absolutely. No correspondence. We didn't discuss. I would
say my conversations with Oswald were at rock bottom minimum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any feeling before the assassination that he had
any hostility toward any individual in the Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. You mean as of the end of December, 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I did not hear him say anything like that. But in reading
this press news after the assassination, it clearly describes there the letter
which he wrote from Minsk to Governor Connally, who was at the time Secretary
of the Navy, and told him that he wants to correct the injustice being done
an ex-serviceman and citizen, and I almost see the period "as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Connally passed it to the Marine Corps, according to the paper, which did
nothing about it. And then I think it was the Newsweek magazine story
which said, quoting Oswald, "Well, I will leave nothing undone to correct this
injustice." That is what I know from the press. To me, I would say that it
looks like a threat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you don't have any knowledge of Oswald's displeasure with
Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Absolutely not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If he had any prior to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina understand English when you first met her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. She said no.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any reason to believe that she could understand
English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes; I said, well, in sort of a joking way, "Well, my God, you
have an American husband. Didn't he teach you sweet nothings." Or something
like that.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I know I love you. Come kiss me quick, or something like that."</p>

<p>But she did not speak English. And when we spoke English in front of her,
for instance, at Mrs. Gregory's, who is not a <span class="locked">Russian&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mrs. Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I said, "Marina, I am sorry, but we have to say these few words
in English."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, that is all right, I will learn it sometime," or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But it did not appear to you that she understood English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. It did not appear to me; yes. And then on that subject I have
talked with you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You told us that you tried to teach her English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Shortly after I saw that she is scared of him. He is a bad
provider, doesn't make friends, I thought there will be a calamity in the family
there sometime.</p>

<p>And Marina Oswald sort of, I think, appreciated when she saw what I tried
to do for her and her kid. I told Marina, "If you are a brave girl, if I were
you, I would prepare myself to stand on my own feet before long. But before
you start anything, you have to speak English."</p>

<p>"Well, how can I learn to speak English. Whenever I try to talk to Lee,
he always come back in Russian and doesn't want me to speak English to him.
This is positively so."</p>

<p>Well, I said, "Will he object if I teach you on the side, so to speak?"</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "let's try".</p>

<p>Now the young Gregory who is taking Russian lessons at the University of
Oklahoma in Norman, who was spending a couple of weeks at home from his
studies of Russian, I know he went to Marina to pick up some Russian lessons
from her, and in exchange gave her a few pointers in English, but he was
leaving for the university so I know that that system was to be short-lived.</p>

<p>Therefore I offered Marina on my own volition without being asked for it,
an excellent dictionary published by the U.S. Government Printing Office in
Washington during World War II as a guide for officers and generals in communicating
with the Russians, and was prepared, as I understand, by the elite
of the Russian emigre academic world in the American society.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you give this to Marina and attempt to teach her the
English language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes. But how I say to read and study, you have to have perseverance.
"Let me try something", I said, and so on this paper I would write
in Russian lesson number one and start writing in big letters in Russian simple
sentences, "My name is Marina Oswald. I live in Fort Worth. We buy groceries
on Tuesday. My husband works on Wednesday. This is a tropical
climate."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You sent those to Marina and asked her to study them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. With a line space in between and asked her to look at the dictionary,
but don't ask anybody, and put underneath in English, which she did
faithfully for approximately 4 weeks, maybe 5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us approximately when this was? They were
living in Fort Worth at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes; I would say that was the last 3 weeks in September, and
maybe the beginning of October which is when she moved to Mrs. Hall's. I
would say it was sometime between September 12 and October 20.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After about four of these lessons she stopped doing it, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. The fifth or sixth lesson did not return. Now just a moment, she
would write the English words. She would send it all back to me and I would
correct it and in turn send it back to her, so she will see what it should have been.</p>

<p>And incidentally, I was shown that by an FBI agent 10 days ago, because a
Russian speaking FBI agent came to see me for 5 minutes. He said, "Please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
take a yellow pad and write 'My name is Marina Oswald. We live in Fort
Worth.'"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He had those lessons that you had sent to Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I don't know what he had. All I could hear was my own words,
because I have a way of speaking myself. He just showed me a photostat of
one of my pages. This was it. And she made progress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She seemed to be a good student of English; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. The first four or five lessons, for two or three pages each. She
made a good headway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she ever come to your house to study Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know if she ever went to visit with Mr. Gregory to
study English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In my previous question I meant English, to study at your
house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Now Marina was in my house with Lee Harvey Oswald and the
baby when I met them at the bus station on or about September 9, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was the only time they were in your house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Precisely. I took them from the bus to my house, changed the
<span class="locked">diaper&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Marina was never in your house in the absence of Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Never. And I never was, to the best of my recollection, and
made a point of it never to be in Marina's house without somebody else being
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now can you tell us why you took such care in that regard?
Why did you make sure that you never went to visit Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Because he was a peculiar guy, and I am not a fighter. I am an
expert fighter with the word, but not with the muscles. And by his smirking
appearances or other expressions on the face, indicated that I am not welcome
and I am persona non grata, because apparently he was jealous that I filled the
icebox once, and when she said that somebody else bought groceries, he said,
"Who did that?" "Why I gave you $2 last week; $2 you got."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether Oswald was ever jealous of the attention
that any other gentlemen in the Russian group might have given to Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I did not see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You do not know about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I did not see, observe, suspect, or hear, because probably I
showed undivided, what I might call, interest in the family as a whole.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So as far as you know, Oswald never was really jealous of any
of your friends or your attention to Marina in any romantic way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I don't know, and he certainly didn't tell me anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you never heard it from anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I did not hear, and I am 60.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; I am not only meaning you, Mr. Bouhe, I mean anyone
else in the group. You never heard any stories to that effect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. But I did think maybe Marina slipped, after the second beer,
"Well, Lee is jealous of you."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She said that about you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes; because I bought groceries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know why Marina stopped studying English at the
end of the fourth lesson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Sir, I wish I knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know the answer to that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Just a moment. I do not know the answer to that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you surprised when you heard that Oswald had been
charged with the assassination of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. You can say that again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why were you surprised?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Because I happened to know the guy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think that Oswald was capable of doing such a thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Never up to that moment. Did not enter my mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He did not appear to you to be a dangerous person in that
respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. He appeared to be critical of the United States, an individual
completely mixed-up, looking, somebody said, for his place under the sun.
But I did not go into the thinking like the psychiatrist thought in the Bronx
in 1952, that he is potentially dangerous, and to whom now this act was almost
a natural for his condition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He did not appear to you prior to the assassination that he
was dangerous in any respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. He liked to get into a fight, I heard and get beaten up, I heard,
off and on, and he struck his wife, gave her a black eye. Yes; he is a tough
guy <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As far as assassinating the President or shooting somebody,
that's never occurred to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know of any connection between Lee Oswald and Jack
Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Thought of it a lot, and I can unqualifiably say, I could not
come to any thought that would make me say yes on that, that I suspect yes&mdash;no,
no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now you testified before that you knew George De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. De Mohrenschildt was a friend of Oswald's; was he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Mr. De Mohrenschildt is a Ph. D., comes from an excellent
family back in the old country, married the right people, knows everybody,
but there is something in him that we have discussed here with Mr. Gregory
in a nice sort of way, a nonconformist, meaning if you invited him to dinner,
formally, he might arrive there in a bathing suit and bring a girl friend which
is not accepted.</p>

<p>When I talked to De Mohrenschildt, who met Oswald somewhere in October
or November, whether at Meller's or Mrs. Ford's, I told him, "George, I just
cannot go on, he is nuts and we are going to have trouble."</p>

<p>By trouble, I meant constant arguments, battling, moving out and all of
that sort of stuff.</p>

<p>George, who liked him, said, "Oh, come on, you are too critical, you are too
big a snob. Just because he didn't come from St. Petersburg, then you drop
them like a hot cake. They are nice people."</p>

<p>"All right, George, you carry the ball."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You said that to De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes; and then on various weekends he would take him to his
society friends, swimming pools, and this and that just like a little hoopla
circus.</p>

<p>So they went through the crowds and maybe they brought them over one
day. If I ran into them at De Mohrenschildt's house once in that period, that
is almost an exaggeration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you say you know De Mohrenschildt did go on and attempt
to help the Oswalds in the manner that you have described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any idea whether De Mohrenschildt exercised
any particular influence over Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I think Oswald had respect for the size and the weight and
the muscles of De Mohrenschildt because on some occasions if he went to tell
something to Oswald, like he had to change a shirt on Wednesday, or not to
be dirty, or do something on Sunday, he wouldn't care&mdash;De Mohrenschildt
would give it to him, tell him, and holler at him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald would do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I don't know whether he did it, but De Mohrenschildt would say
it. Whether that registered or not, that I don't know. I wouldn't even say it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Bouhe, I want to show you five photographs of a man, and
these photographs have all been marked in the testimony that Mrs. Ruth Paine
gave before the Commission. We do not have the numbers here. I will ask you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
if you recognize this man or these men. [Commission Exhibits 451, 453&ndash;456,
WJL.]</p>

<p>First of all, does it appear to you that they are all pictures of the same man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. If I saw him, it must be in my dreams. I don't remember seeing
that man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you observe any resemblance between these pictures and
Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I would say no. Am I wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have anything else now, Mr. Bouhe, that you think
that we should know in connection with this matter before we terminate. I
have no more questions that I want to ask, do you have anything else that you
think we ought to know before we finish?</p>

<p>Let me ask you one more question. Did Oswald drink, as far as you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Drink?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. He took one vodka in my house, and he probably took a couple
of drinks at Katya Ford's house. I think that I saw him with a glass, but do
not know if it was ginger ale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He was not a strong drinker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Never saw or heard or smelled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have anything else that you want to call to our attention
that you think would help us in this matter?</p>

<p>Let me say this, we are going to be here in Dallas for the next 2 or 3 days.
Why don't you think over your testimony, and if you have anything else that
you want to tell us that you think we should know, you get in touch with us,
and we will make arrangements to talk to you about it at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is there anything that occurs to you now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I cannot think of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If you think of it in the next 2 days, you call the U.S. attorney's
office and we will make arrangements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Is that Mr. Sanders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I talked incessantly today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In view of the fact that Mr. Bouhe has nothing that he can
think of at this point and in view of the fact that I have no further questions,
I would like to terminate the examination at this time with the final question
of you, Mr. Bouhe, as to whether there is anything we have talked about here that
has not been taken down by the court reporter, that we have not subsequently
put on the record for the benefit of the record that you think ought to be on the
record? In other words, in our conversation here today we have discussed a
couple of matters off the record, and I ask you now, isn't it a fact that everything
we discussed off the record we subsequently discussed while the reporter was
writing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Absolutely; after the clarification was obtained. But I must say
I am a quick thinking man and fast talking, but at this moment I cannot think
of anything. But as usual, I will go out and lie down and will think of something,
so don't hold it against me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You will think of something that we have not discussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. Because I have seen 11 FBI agents and 3 from the Secret Service,
of which 2 were speaking Russian, or were natives of Russia, and I&mdash;by the way,
where do I go out? Will the name unfortunately appear in the paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. No; not as far as we know. You don't want any publicity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. I tell you, I certainly don't want any publicity. Too, I am fearful,
because you probably heard about this&mdash;is this on the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bouhe</span>. This is Dallas, and you know there is a lot of shootings going
on, and as I read in the paper at the time Oswald was being captured at the
Texas Theatre, some mob was assembling and they were holding him out there,
and screaming, "Kill the Republicans," and you can see <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We will see to it that your name is not mentioned in connection
with the affair. At this point I think we can terminate.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. It's first town in Russia, town after Ukraine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That would be in southern Russia then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you now an American citizen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I am an American citizen since 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did you come to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. As a refugee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. In January 11, 1952.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you leave Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I left Russia around 1943.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In 1943?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You left Russia at the time the German Army retreated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes, the corps of Germans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Germans took you from Russia and took you back to
Germany?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After you left Russia did you go to Germany?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I went to Poland first then from Poland to Germany, then from
Germany to United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was Mr. Meller with you at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Mr. Meller I met in Germany and married in Germany short
before we came to United States. Year, I just may not be exactly in the dates.
I am just a little bit forgetful always but I would say we met, 1946, I met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Off record comment.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Concerning your departure from Russia, were you taken by the
German Army from Russia or did you leave Russia of your own free will and go
to Germany?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No; I was taken by the Germans from Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that prior to the retreat of the German Army or with
the retreat of the German Army?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Part of the retreat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why did the Germans take you from Russia; do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. They took many young people on the streets. If you walk on
the streets they will make a circle around several blocks and who is inside
everybody going by train. I certainly tried to prevent myself as much as I
could to go out and then I talk a little bit German and all that, but I held part
of luck little bit, I stay in country and worked for Germans for piece of bread so
I wouldn't die of hunger because Russia was in bad shape, and then that very
place hospital was retreated back. I went with or I had to stay and die of
hunger. That way, I was brought piece by piece further deeper into Poland
and Germany.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't really want to leave Russia at the time; you wanted
to remain in Russia, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. That's quite a question. I never liked regime in Russia in
politics. I don't understand those things but I never liked those regime in
Russia; even at 16 I would ask father such questions it would raise his hair.
I could not understand what was going around, why we could not talk freely at
home and things like that, always afraid of something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you learn to speak English, Mrs. Meller?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. We took with my husband in Germany year before we came
to United States, we took private lessons for about a year or little bit more
than a year and when I came to United States I had pretty good vocabulary, I
can speak and I could write but I was afraid to speak. I forget all my vocabulary
as soon as someone ask me something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you come directly to Dallas when you came to the United
States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Sir, we came to New York and from New York, several names
they call and says that in past times they send too many refugees in north, we
suppose to go to Milwaukee and he says those families several go to the south,
he said to Texas and I am ashamed to say I heard about Texas but never heard
about Dallas. I heard Houston and Austin but never heard Dallas, and <span class="locked">we&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And then you came to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. We came to Dallas and are in Dallas 12 or almost 13 years
here and love it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you work now, Mrs. Meller?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes, I work 11 years for Dallas Power &amp; Light Co. as draftsman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As a draftsman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have training in draftsmanship work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes; I love drafting all my life and I wanted to be architect
but I finish school in dentistry and war came. I passed all examinations besides
the main diploma when war started so I get my diploma&mdash;without the
main diploma&mdash;without examination of&mdash;from my dentistry examination but I
get my diploma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, you were a qualified dentist in the Soviet Union before you
left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes; I got my document but without final examination of dentistry
because war started. By the way, I was always good in drafting back
in school and I wanted to be always a draftsman or architect but it was too
many people and everybody was interested in architecture so you have to be
the very best one to make it and I wasn't the best one in physics, I remember, and
I couldn't possibly&mdash;and it was time when girl supposed to have higher education,
it started just then in Russia. Parents said you have to take something
and finish so you have some kind of job, but when I was starting dentistry there
was certain difficulties in the family. I was working at night as nurse in
hospital and helping my sister with drafting so I get always money on the side
little bit so I could proceed my studying. When I came to United States I
have pretty bad veins. I could not stay very much on my feet; I had phlebitis
when I arrived short after and doctor said better I will have sitting job
better than standing because modern dentist have to stay very much on his
legs so I took drafting. I went for my own interest to Crozier architecture
school and took course in Dallas so I could see what drafting look like in United
States. Since that time I love it and my job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Does your husband work also?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. My husband works, too, at Sangers Harris as packer for 11
years or 12. I will say 12 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is your husband also from Russia originally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No; my husband from Poland, born in Poland, finish two universities.
He's professor of philosophy and teacher of physical education.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did there come a time that you met Lee Harvey Oswald and
his wife, Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. We were invited one day in August, I think end of August in
1962, we were invited to Fort Worth to Mr. Peter Gregory&mdash;I, my husband and
Mr. George Bouhe. My husband couldn't go and I want to make something&mdash;we
don't have a house here. We don't have car here. We have one bedroom
apartment we live for past 10 year in same place. When we were invited there,
my husband couldn't go so Mr. George Bouhe picked me up and because he had
a car and we went to Fort Worth. At Mr. Gregory family, we met Marina and
Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who else was there at the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I think it was wife from Peter Gregory, Mr. Gregory, his <span class="locked">son&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Paul Gregory?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Paul Gregory, myself, and George Bouhe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that a luncheon meeting or was it in the evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. It was a dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In the evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us to the best of your recollection the conversation
that took place and what happened at this first dinner at which you
met the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. We met them and Mr. Gregory said they come from Russia not
long ago and we find out immediately that Marina could not speak word of
English whatsoever. The baby was probably about 4 months old, baby girl was
with. We talked; we didn't have something important, just were speaking
about condition in United States and how Marina likes and if you had a job&mdash;Lee
Harvey. By the way, the first impression of Lee Harvey is a man absolutely
sick. I mean mentally sick; you could not speak with him about anything.
He's against Soviet Union; he's against United States. He made impression
he did not know what he likes, really. She was more quiet and certainly did
not spoke much; since we met each other first time, nobody spoke too much.
Really, it was easy going conversation but not much. We asked how is her
baby and we find out baby didn't have a bed and she didn't have anything to
wear and I even don't remember if he had a job at this time already; I don't
remember exactly or he was looking for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you carry on the conversation in English or in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. In Russian more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It was quite clear to you at that time that Marina was not
able to speak English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes; absolutely not a word, absolutely not a word; however,
he spoke Russian pretty good to understand, amazingly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was his Russian grammatically correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Pretty correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you where he learned Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I don't remember exactly. Later I heard certain somebody
asked because we were wondering how he could speak and he said he took
English in school and studied very much at home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Russian you mean.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Russian in school and studied at home very much with himself
as Marina said later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think that his command of the Russian language was
better than you would expect for the period of time that he had spent in
Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes; absolutely better than I would expect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever indicate that he had gone to any school in Russia
to learn Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. You know, he tried to not to speak much. He was not easy
to come to it and speak. He will say some sentences and tried to be more
quiet. He was on the quiet side but if he didn't like something, he would raise
his voice and get very excited&mdash;upset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You said your first impression just was he appeared mentally
sick. Can you tell us some of the specific reasons why you came to that conclusion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Later on, when I saw him&mdash;I saw him two times or three in the
whole period and I saw him mad about some things, about people tried to help
Marina with warm clothes and baby clothes. He did not want to take anything.
He always said "I don't need". He was against everything and he did not want
his wife try to speak English, not a single word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you why he did not want her to learn English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. He said he wanted to learn better Russian. She has to speak
Russian so he can speak better Russian; she don't need English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald tell you at this first meeting why he went to
Russia in the first place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No; I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let's go on and establish the other times that you saw Oswald
and the circumstances and then I will ask you some questions about his experiences
in Russia and you can tell me whether he ever told you about anything
or when you learned about anything. When did you next see Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Later on, probably in the next month, we visited Marina Oswald
about two or three times and during this time, couple times, probably one time we
did not see him at all. He started to work somewhere and two times we met him
we came close to five or probably close to six, to Fort Worth and he come straight
from work, still in work clothes and we speak little bit this time. We brought&mdash;always
for Marina, we brought some groceries for Marina, George Bouhe and I,
some clothes to wear and for baby and I saw baby didn't have bed. Baby was
sleeping on two suit cases, old suit cases. It was a made baby bed. I never
talk much to Lee Oswald and he was pretty quiet most of the time. However,
probably on the last time I went over their house, we stayed for hour there or
maybe even less, give those things and come back home. On the third time
probably, I noticed in the living room on what you will call that table that the
lamp was sitting near the divan. I notice several books; it was "Kapital" book
Karl Marx and literature about Communism. It caught my eye and I was
real upset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you say anything to Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I said to Marina "What's this book doing here", something like
that. I mentioned something and she said Lee takes all those books from the
library and reading them. I did not say much after but I was real upset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that the last time that you saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. It was maybe last time that we visited Marina in her house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
No; excuse me just a second, sir. One of these times we came to Marina house
and husband was still not at home she has a terrible blue spot over her eye
and I said to her "What's the matter?" Marina was shy little bit. She's shy
little, a little bit in nature, I think, too. She said "I have to get up during
night and quiet baby and I hit the door and hit my head here" and it was very
blue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Around her eye?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Under her eye was and over here [indicating] and it was very
noticeable I will say. I said "You have to be careful" but I felt always like
girl tried to hide something, you know. She was shy and not very&mdash;didn't like
to talk too much, I think. That's last time I went; it was on Mercedes Avenue
in Fort Worth where they had home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never saw Lee Oswald except for this first meeting at
Peter Gregory's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. At Gregory's and then one time at home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No; at their home where they lived, Marina and Oswald on
Mercedes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Fort Worth; and that is the only place you ever saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes. I never visit him by myself and never without George
Bouhe. We were always together&mdash;group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you make a special point out of going as a group and not
going one person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Well, I would tell you, before we started to help Marina and
Oswald somebody raise the question&mdash;I tried to remember who but I couldn't&mdash;I
think our friend Mr. Clark from Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Max Clark?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes; and George Bouhe and I said, I said "You know, George,
he's check?" "He comes from Soviet Union" and somebody said, I think George
Bouhe said "I asked and they tell me he's checked." I thought if he's checked
with FBI you suppose not to be afraid to help them, something like that. It was
my own inside feelings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were sort of suspicious of Oswald because he had been in
the Soviet Union for a while?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. We could not understand why he stayed there and come back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it seem strange to you that he was able to leave the Soviet
Union and bring Marina back to the United States with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. When somebody asked, he told them they&mdash;they let&mdash;they go to
American Embassy and they let him go. It seem like it was supposed to be in
order if they give him even money and American Embassy let him go. I thought
it must be in order. I never heard of anything in my lifetime, anything like
that happen. I don't recall any case like this one having so much sorrow and
trouble. It was in Fort Worth then, I do not recall. We will go in more there
later. We find out that Lee Harvey lost his job. I think by the last time we
saw Lee Harvey Marina mentioned he is temporary there and may lose his job
pretty soon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was his job in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes; and I said "Well, if you can't find a job in Fort Worth,
come to Dallas and look around." Then one day we heard he was looking for a
job in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let me go back to the time that Oswald lived in Fort Worth.
You said that you and Mr. Bouhe had given groceries to the Oswalds and helped
them in other ways. Would you tell me approximately, and take your time to
think about it, how much groceries and what other things were given to the
Oswalds during that period by friends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. It was pretty good. I would give her old dresses. I asked
three friends to give me something old, old dresses for her, about 10 to 15
dresses, probably. We bought some underwear, probably two, three pairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. For Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. For Marina, strictly for Marina. When we met her we had
sorrow for Marina for not speaking word of English; just for sake of woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
with baby. Seems her husband will not care for her about anything. We
never saw he will be <span class="locked">really&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Responsible?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Responsible for her; thank you, sir; yes. I never saw that
feelings, never, and being a Russian myself and go through certain trouble during
World War II where the good people helped us very much for all sides of
walks when I came to United States, even I was brought up in family at home
to help somebody if I can in trouble, so I saw Russian girl couldn't speak word
of English and baby and looks like husband didn't caring much about her, it
was our mutual feelings toward Marina start to help her. It was only idea.
Somehow it sounds strange but somehow it even looks to me like&mdash;we didn't see
Lee Harvey buying anything, very little; they was just existing&mdash;woman and
baby in hands, baby 4 months old, young girl. When we went to, George Bouhe
and I, to house we took her to store in Fort Worth and George Bouhe bought
about $18 groceries and I tried to let her pick up some of the things she would
like and first thing she started with baby food. I will tell you, she's young but
it's amazing how she cares about children. She's young mother; she gives pretty
good care of the children. I looked and I was wondering; baby was first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it only on one occasion that you purchased groceries for
them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I don't recall exactly but I think it was more probably two
occasions that George Bouhe spent lot of money. Second time, I think he bought
for child baby playpen, excuse me, I am not familiar with those names, playpen
and certainly we tried to buy cheaper and something because child did not have
bed and it was same time bed for the child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Bouhe also bought a bed for the baby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No; he bought playpen and it was for time bed for the baby. I
think we bought her one dress, probably couple underwears, couple pairs, and
stockings; something she is really need and certainly more groceries. Then one
day when came with groceries like that Lee Harvey come from work and Mr.
Bouhe told him to come with and try to help to pick up playpen. He was
furious why we did all that and buy all that and he said "I don't need"; he was
in rage; "I don't need," he say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he go with Mr. Bouhe to get the playpen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. He went but you can see it was not like he had to go&mdash;it was
something which was real hard for him to do it&mdash;never talked much and I could
not talk much to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think that he was strange or somewhat peculiar because
he resented this help that you tried to give him, or did you understand
that perhaps he had good reasons?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Sir, he was peculiar, yes; he was and I think he was a person
which will not go; he was not easy to go with the other people. He could not
talk like&mdash;I see first time and anyway, to explain as much as I could, but I
doubt if he would talk to you same way I do. He had always something hidden;
you can feel it. He was not very&mdash;not willing to talk and very much against,
against the food you buy, against the milk for baby&mdash;"We don't need anything."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever know how much money he was making at his
job in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No; no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he say anything to you about repayment of a loan that the
United States had made to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes; he said that he has to pay to Embassy back money and
that's what he was doing and he had to send certain amount to American
Embassy to pay their passage but I never asked how much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you knew or he told you at that time that he was making
payments to the American Government?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes; he was paying; if I am not wrong, I think he say he
mentioned he had to pay and what is left he will never say and I think it was
not much at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever give any money to Marina or did you just confine
your help to buying groceries and clothes and giving her clothes and buying the
playpen and that sort of thing?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Well, I give her $5.00 some good soul give it to me and I give
her $5.00 and I spend two or $3.00, little bit, not as much as George Bouhe.
It's our very good friend, George Bouhe; he&mdash;we haven't so very much and he
is person who helps everybody. I mean, he never&mdash;how to explain&mdash;interested
what nationality you are. If you are in need and you are not lazy, let me
point that out, he is willing to help with his strength, with his car go with
you and help everywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember who gave you the $5.00 to give to Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. $5.00&mdash;my goodness! If I could remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It isn't that important, but if you remember to keep it from
being counted twice.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Just a second, I think it was Mrs. <span class="locked">Steed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How do you spell that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Steed [spelling], from oilman, wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did either Oswald or Marina at any time that you knew them
tell you or say in your hearing what kind of a job Oswald had while he was
in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Oh, my goodness, yes; he mentioned something but, something&mdash;how
to explain&mdash;something that you have with machinery. I mean something
to fix like hard&mdash;just like hardware store, something with those things. I
think it was a dirty job. Not exactly locks but some kind of job in factory
with screws and some gauges, I think is kind of work he did but I am very
sorry I never was listening real good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you how much he was paid at the job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I don't recall; I just did not pay much attention. I know he
was having a pretty good room there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he tell you about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. That he was having good room and something&mdash;maybe I am
not right, sir, I am afraid to say, like $80 month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Eighty rubles?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Eighty rubles a month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he say or indicate he received help from the Red Cross
or any other phase of the Embassy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As far as you know any money he ever received in Russia is
from his job, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes; and I am not clear here because I may have heard something
and never paid much attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever mention anything about hunting trips he used to
go on in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Something he said one time that he went with some Russian
boys, probably young people, hunting one time, I think he mentioned and it
was something like duckhunting, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To the best of your recollection, he said that he only went on
one hunting trip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I mean I heard him saying one time that, just sort mention;
he will not go in any detail anywhere I think as much as I know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you or did Marina tell you about the circumstances
under which Marina and Lee met and became married in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Just far away rumors like I cannot imagine because I am not
clear with that. It is so far away and so unclear I am afraid to let you know
but in short, I think Marina said she met him at somewhere at a dancing place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina tell you that she had lived in Leningrad for awhile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I think she was born there and lived some time and then was
in Minsk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you why she moved from Leningrad to Minsk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No; never asked much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever tell you why he decided to return to the
United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I do not remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he speak of any difficulties that he had in returning to
the United States, that you remember?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No; I will not say; it was mentioned Embassy and that Embassy
even decided to help with the money. That was all I think I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever express any dislike toward the State Department
or the Embassy because they delayed his return to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever express any hostility toward the U.S. Government,
that you can remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I will not say. I just do not recall. He never said too much
is what I say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear him speak of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No, never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever speak of Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he appear to you to be a dangerous person at the time that
you knew him in the sense that he would become violent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Not exactly dangerous but he would look ridiculous in ways.
He was some kind of strange person; you cannot talk to him. You could not
find two sentences that will go without difficulties. He will always say something
against&mdash;some way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever get the impression as to whether Oswald was
well liked when he was in Russia or was he unpopular when he was in Russia,
do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. My personal opinion, this person could never be friendly with
anybody, very friendly, I mean. He was such a person that you never can
come near even if you want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina ever tell you or give you any indication as to
why she married Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. That's quite a question&mdash;why she married Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I don't remember what she said but I remember one sentence
which is even caught in my head that she said. She wished all her life to have
room of her own, is what she said after, you know; that she's tired living not
like a human living. She wanted to have piece of her personal life and piece
of her room just to her own. I remember her expressing that very, very deeply.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, do you remember that some time in the fall of 1962,
after the Oswalds had moved out of their apartment in Fort Worth that Marina
called you on the telephone one evening and told you that she wanted to leave
Oswald? Would you tell us about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes, yes, sir. It was in November, I think on certain Monday
about 10 in the evening, she will call me and say that her husband beat her
and she came out from the apartment and reached the filling station and said
the man&mdash;she did not have a penny of money, and the good soul helped her to
dial my number and she's talking to me if she can come over my house. I was
speechless because to this time I even didn't know they were in Dallas. To
understand, sir, we went to Fort Worth two or three times to help Marina
and then was for certain period quiet and then I do not know how long, maybe
6 weeks, maybe month, maybe 3 weeks and then I had this call. I said "Where
are you?" She said "In Dallas." Certainly, then my husband was at home;
I came to my husband and I asked him if we can take Marina. He did not
want to. We have one bedroom apartment and he said "Do not have very
much space." I like a maniac woman, started to beg and said "We have to
help poor woman; she's on the street with baby. We could not leave her like
that; we had our trouble and somebody helped us." My husband said "Okay
let her come. She said to me she did not have a penny of money. I said "Take
a taxi and come here and we will pay the way." So, about 11 or 10:40 she
came over our house so like she was staying in light blouse and skirt with
baby on her hand, couple diapers and that was all; no coat, no money, nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she appear to have been beaten up at that time; did
she have bruises?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. She was very nervous; did not try to cry very much but you
can see she was shaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she appear to be bruised?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I will not say exactly but she was out of herself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She seemed to be upset?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Nervous, upset and looked like&mdash;she did not cry exactly and
at me now but looks like she cried&mdash;her eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you what she and Oswald had been arguing about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I do not remember. She said he beat her and I do not remember
asking really for what or something. I did not ask for arguments, really,
because it was so shocking and so unagreeable. I do not think I went into detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long did Marina stay with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Marina stay, I think 1 week, 5 days at my home, something
like Monday until Friday and Friday she went to another family by the name
of Mr. Ford, Mr. and Mrs. Ford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina tell you any time during that week that she stayed
with you what she and Oswald had been arguing about and what their difficulties
were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No, no; she did not say much. She mention that her husband
could not find proper jobs. They don't want to take him or he could not find;
she did not know herself very much. You can see without speaking word of
English I do not know what he could come home and tell her; I cannot imagine.
She said Lee could not find job and they are in trouble and she did not say much.
By the way, she was so skinny to this time and so undernourished; look as skinny
as she could be and she did not feel good. She had pain everywhere in her body
and looking at her I decided to take her to doctor and let check her health a
little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you take her to the doctor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. So, I took her during this week she stay with me. I took her
to the G-y-n by the name Doctor Paul Wolff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. W-o-l-f [spelling]?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes, W-o-l-f-f [spelling].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. W-o-l-f-f [spelling].</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. He give her examination and said in my presence, said she's
very undernourished and if she will not put at least 5 pounds immediately she
will have pain everywhere; that she is just weak and need to eat better and
mean she was not eating good at all. She had bad appetite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina tell you how long she had been living in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I do not remember, sir, exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember her saying anything about living in the home
of Elena Hall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Elena Hall; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did she tell you about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. That Mrs. Hall was very good to her and she stayed there probably
about 3 weeks if not more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you how long it had been since she lived in Mrs.
Hall's home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Can you repeat that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; did she tell you how long it had been since she had left
Mrs. Hall's home? In other words, I want to know how long she had been living
in Dallas with Oswald.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No; I do not recall her saying. But may I go back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. It is time&mdash;thank you for remembering, helping me here. It
was the time between Fort Worth and our family and, in other words, I think
now like it is my recollection he lost a job in Fort Worth and went to Dallas
look for job. During this time Marina stay at Mrs. Hall home for 3 or 4 weeks,
if I am correct. It is not easy to remember, really, and during this time we
heard, I think he called on telephone to us, Lee Harvey, and asked if we know
something, if we can help him with a job. In all time when we visited them in
apartment in Fort Worth and I heard from Marina that her husband may lose
job pretty soon, maybe next week or later because he was temporary there,
just like good soul, I say "You have to come to Dallas which is larger town
and maybe he find job." I did not say personally about George Bouhe maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
he find job there, just mention in general. So he called and ask if we can help
him and again, as I repeat, for the sake of the poor woman which could not
speak word of English and her little baby, I asked my husband. I was stupid
enough to beg him to help to find job for Lee Harvey in Dallas. Mr. Meller
has a former friend with whom he was working back at Harris but this time
it was not Sanger-Harris. It was just A. Harris store and he was working
with certain Mrs. Helen Cunningham. Later, Mrs. Cunningham left A. Harris
and was working for employment office in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Texas Employment Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Texas Employment Commission; so, I asked him and I said
"Your former friend, Mrs. Helen Cunningham, maybe she can find job for
him. Please ask her." He did not want to do it. He said just because I ask
him and begged him so much he called Mrs. Helen Cunningham; told her we
had a couple which arrived from Russia; she's Russian, and he is American.
They are not very long here and he is looking for job but he made a note and
he said, "Mrs. Cunningham, be careful and check him because he came from
Soviet Union." He said be careful so we would not have any trouble and you
understand, because we did not like they came from Soviet Union and I do
not know, however, we heard somebody mention he was checked and Mrs.
Cunningham said, "Don't worry, Mr. Meller; we will try do right thing," and
that was all when he called to us. He came one time during this period without
Marina for half hour to my house. I give him sandwich and cup of tea and he
went back to look for jobs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you at that time where he had been looking for
jobs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. He will not mention exactly. He was sleeping; I think he
was staying YMCA this time, living there and looking for job. He said he
has little piece of paper and some notices there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Names on them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. But he never go into detail, never, never, never. He will mention
but you will never find details out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear of any other place where Lee Oswald stayed
during this period other than the YMCA?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Never hear and when Marina Oswald later called me at night,
I was speechless that she was already in Dallas and we did not know a word
and when she mention name where she&mdash;they were living, I did not have address.
I did not know where they were living, how long they are; they did
not say a thing but I took her home, over my house for 5 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Then she went to Mrs. Ford's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Then she went to Mrs. Ford's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know how long she stayed there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I believe 1 week, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she then go to the home <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Then she went to Mr. and Mrs. Ray.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Ray?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I tried remember first name&mdash;Frank Ray.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is it Thomas or Frank?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Frank Ray; Frank Ray. I think Ray. Now, it was the last
time we saw Marina. By the way, I must apologize&mdash;coming back when she
was living at our home, we did not&mdash;she was separated with Lee Harvey to
this time. She went out from him. He never call to our home. He never
visited. We were working people. We will leave her with food at my home and
we will come back in the evening. Nobody call; she never went somewhere
because we do not have a car, or even if George Bouhe help with car, something,
because we did not have car, could not drive either. It was last time
when I saw Marina Oswald and her girl who was about 4 or 6 months, I think.
She was not even sitting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Don't you remember seeing Lee and Marina Oswald at a
party at the Fords?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. It was after I saw them at my house in December maybe.
I do not recall exactly day, 20 or 22 December; it was party at home of Mr.
and Mrs. Ford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Could it have been the 28th of December, after Christmas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes; it was 28th; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell me us about that party, would you, please&mdash;who was there;
did Oswald come?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Well, I do not know; it was probably over 20 people there
and as I heard, Marina and Oswald were not invited there at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember who told you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. But were invited certain Mr. and Mrs. <span class="locked">De&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. De Mohrenschildt, thank you very much, and I heard from
the other people that the De Mohrenschildt's called to Mr. and Mrs. Ford
and asked if he can bring with him people, Marina and Oswald. They are
all lost by themselves, have no place to go or something and he brought them
with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see Oswald come with De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I did not see exactly walking in but I heard then that he
brought them there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see Oswald that night at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes; I saw him; he was strange acting and strange looking, cold,
not very talkative. It was a certain Japanese girl, don't know her name, he was
all evening with this girl and Marina was left all by herself going with one group
of people or another and when finally somebody play with piano, I see her sitting,
trying to catch some songs singing and I saw her try to smile, try to make her
face human. I did not remember seeing her and him together this evening. He
was all time with different girl which we met first time and I do not recognize
her name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you ever seen the Japanese girl since?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Never saw before or after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know how we can get her name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Do not recall name or anything, sir; I am very sorry. I would
like to help you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to Oswald that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Do not remember anything; my memory&mdash;don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald drink at the party at all; did you notice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Do not remember seeing him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether Oswald ever drank very much?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Never saw him drink; do not recall. I saw Marina eating pretty
much; looks like she was real hungry. Some our friends notice and we had pity
for the girl maybe she did not have at home anything to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see Oswald leave the party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recall any discussion about Oswald after he left the
party? Did you overhear any conversation about him and Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No; do not recall; I heard something from the people talking
in a group and it was certain person by the name of, oh, my goodness, excuse me
just a second my husband help me with the name&mdash;Lev Aronson, and I heard
later that he talked to Lee Oswald and says that he is a poor idiot and completely
crazy man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you why he thought that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No; I did not talk to him. I heard that conversation, you know,
going with a group of people and it was <span class="locked">just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have a party at your house some time following the
party at the Ford residence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. After Ford party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have an open house on the day following?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No; you mean 29 of December?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; approximately.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Just a second, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Or the next day&mdash;within a few days following the Ford party?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I could not recall really, but if I had, I never had Oswalds over
to my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know Charles Edward Harris from Georgetown, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Charles Edward Harris, yes; I met him one time or two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was he at the Ford party; do you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I do not think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any discussion as far as you can recall either at the
Ford party or at your place or anywhere during this period of time where the
question of whether Lee Oswald was a Russian agent was discussed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss that question with anybody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No; never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear anybody discuss it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it ever occur to you that Oswald might be an agent of the
Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Could not say; can be but I cannot say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You do not remember talking about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No; we never talked about that; I remember exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, have you told us everything that you can remember about
your meetings with Oswald and Marina that you think the Commission would be
interested in; can you think of anything else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I am thinking and seems to be that's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How well do you know De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. How long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Oh, I know him about 6 years, probably; met him very seldom
and we were never friends, real close, never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was he friendly with Oswald, do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Try to help, I think was&mdash;try to help as much as we did. He
had a car; he took them, I think to Anna Ray house and tried to bring some of
her dresses and things belonging. If he was later together with Lee Oswald,
I do not have any idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you surprised when you heard that Oswald had been
arrested in connection with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I do not&mdash;if I say surprised or was shocked when President
Kennedy was assassinated: I was shocked. I was in such sorrow that I could
not explain to you. I do not have enough English words in my vocabulary to
describe what shock it was and later, when I find out it was Lee Harvey, I was
completely shocked. I was completely out of my place and afraid for what a
person, if he really did that, what it could happen to us. It was terrible shock;
I could not explain to you. We could not believe at first at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were very surprised when you heard it was Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. We could not believe he will do things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember being interviewed by the FBI?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes, sir; three times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Three times?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;oh, I mean from FBI one time; Secret Service another
time, and third time it was from police. I cannot recall name but it was
three times together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As far as you can remember the FBI only interviewed you once?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes; once FBI, once Secret Service, and once Dallas group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it the Dallas police force?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Dallas police officers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever form an opinion as to who was responsible for
these marital difficulties the Oswalds were having? Did you think it was
mostly Lee Harvey's fault or did you think it was partly her fault, or what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. It was not easy to judge but I think since we do not know
them very close and very long, let's say this way but it seems to me again
that Lee Oswald was not normal because later I heard from somebody that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
he beat Marina and he did one time, I think even Marina told to me that when
they moved in apartment the bulb is burned through and she has to put new
lamp in it. He demanded when the master is home the bathtub supposed to
be full with water so he can take bath before he sit down to eat and one time
he come home and it was dark and she has to put lamp in the room, she did
not have time to put water in the tub and he find tub was without water and
he beat her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Marina told you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. I think she told me that or somebody from our group; I do
not recall who, but I remember that and I was shocked. I thought that something
must be wrong with man if he is every time running to beat her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never saw or talked to either Oswald or Marina at anytime
after the party at the Ford residence around Christmas time, 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No, never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. No, sir; never and probably passed 1 year and 2 months since we
did not hear or did not know from them anything. When it happened&mdash;when
the assassination happened, it passed 12 to 14 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did not hear that they had moved from Dallas to New
Orleans and back to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Nothing; not a word, not a telephone call, or nothing. It was
the last time at Ford's family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't have any more questions, Mrs. Meller. If you can think
of anything else that you would like to add, just go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Would love if I remember but so far I try to think if I did
not forget anything. I do not think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Then we shall terminate the deposition at this time. I want
to thank you very much for being so cooperative and coming down and giving
us the testimony you have and the Commission appreciates it very much. You
have been a very good and gracious witness; thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Meller</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="t391"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_ELENA_A_HALL" id="TESTIMONY_OF_ELENA_A_HALL">TESTIMONY OF ELENA A. HALL</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Elena A. Hall was taken at 5 p.m., on March 24, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mrs. Hall, would you please rise and raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth in the testimony that you are about to give?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I sure do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mrs. Hall, my name is Wesley J. Liebeler. This is Albert
Jenner. We are both of the legal staff of the President's Commission investigating
the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>The Staff has been authorized to take testimony from you and from other
witnesses by the Commission pursuant to authority which has been granted
to the Commission by Executive Order 11130 dated November 29, 1963, and Joint
Resolution of Congress 137.</p>

<p>It is my understanding that Mr. Rankin, general counsel of the Commission
sent you a letter last week and included copies of those two documents, as well
as a copy of the rules of procedure pertaining to the taking of testimony. Did
you receive that letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. With that letter were included copies of those documents referred
to, isn't that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We want to question you today about your knowledge of Lee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
and Marina Oswald, which knowledge you obtained as a result of your association
with them after they returned, after Oswald returned from Russia sometime
in 1962. I understand that your association with Oswald continued over
a period of time and that you last saw him at approximately Easter of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. First of all, will you state your full name for the record?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Elena A. Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your address, Mrs. Hall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. 4760 Trail Lake Drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Fort Worth, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are married to Mr. John R. Hall, isn't that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You and Mr. Hall operate a dental laboratory in Fort Worth,
isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where were you born in Iran? In what town?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Tehran.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When were you born?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. 1926.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It is the Commission's understanding that your parents were
originally from Russia, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did they move to Tehran?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. 1920 or 1921.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where in Russia had they lived prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. The last in Baku.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us briefly the reasons that prompted your parents
to leave Russia and go to Tehran?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. The Communists. When the Communists started in, my father was
over in the Russian Army in Siberia. He was a prisoner, and after he got out,
he escaped, they came back. I mean they came to Iran.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did they eventually move to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; my mother was here in 1960, but she came just to visit and
went back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are they still living in Tehran?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; both are dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Both are dead?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us the circumstances surrounding your moving to the
United States, if you would.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, I worked for 10 years. I worked for dentists, and I knew
a little bit of laboratory work. Then I decided to continue and have some kind
of diploma, and that is why I came to the United States.</p>

<p>My best friends, they were coming to the United States. So they told me
that there are some technology schools here in the United States that I can
go and accomplish my dental technology, and that is why I came to New York
and was in the dental technology school where I met John. So he wanted&mdash;instead
of going back, I married him and came to Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you move to the United States, Mrs. Hall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. 1957?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us briefly what your educational background
was in Tehran before you moved to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. High-school education. I was 6 years in French school and 5
years in Russian school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you specialize in any special field during your education?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It was just a general education?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After you married your husband in New York and subsequently
moved to Dallas, or Fort <span class="locked">Worth&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. We were married in Fort Worth and I came here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During your husband's testimony, he said that you were first
married in <span class="locked">19&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were subsequently divorced and then remarried again in
November of 1962, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you eventually meet Lee Harvey Oswald and his wife
Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us in your own words and to the best of your
recollection when you first met them, and the circumstances. Go right ahead
and tell your own story of your acquaintance with the Oswalds right up until
the last time you saw them. I will interrupt you as little as possible.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, I was working for Patterson Porcelain Laboratory at that
time when I met Oswald. Mrs. George Bouhe brought them to our house. At
that time I was by myself. John wasn't there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you and your husband divorced at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; we were. George Bouhe, that is, thought that I could do
something for Marina because she had a missing tooth, and I told him that
I will try. Then I asked a couple of doctors and they couldn't do with that
little money that George Bouhe offered. He offered $50 to $75, and said, "I
will pay for it," but it was much more than that, so I could do nothing. And
that was the first time I met him. It was sometime in July, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Of 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. In July of 1962. After that I saw her, how poor they were.
They really didn't have anything. She didn't have any clothes. So I told my
friends, married friends, couple of them. They gave the money. And I asked
another lady who gave me a lot of clothes for her. And in this way I start to
learn sometimes&mdash;give her some money or buy her some clothes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you give Marina money from time to time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I didn't give her money. I bought clothes for her. George
Bouhe gave them money and other people. I bought her clothes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who gave you money besides Mr. Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Mrs. Patterson, the lady that I worked for. I mean my employer's
wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is her first name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Loraine Patterson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How much money did she give you, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I don't remember. It was $10, or $15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How much did Bouhe give you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Twenty dollars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You received that money to buy groceries for Marina, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; it was only for her clothes while they were living in Fort
Worth, and I mean not in my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did anybody else give you any money for the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I spent myself, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. For them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. For them, yes. I didn't buy groceries there at that time. I
bought little toys for the little girl, but I never did buy groceries until they
moved to my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you estimate approximately how much money altogether
you have spent for Marina's clothes, and such items as that before they moved
out of the apartment in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. My money or just general?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Altogether. You said that you thought Bouhe had given you
$20?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And Mrs. Patterson, $10 or $15, so that would have been $30 or
$35?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I spent probably $25 or $30 myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So it would be $50 to $60?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Something like that, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Go ahead with your story.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, I was going to see her sometime in the lunchtime because
it was very close to my work. They lived not very far from my work. And
then after they&mdash;I think he lost his job in Fort Worth and he decided that there
is better opportunity here in Dallas, to move.</p>

<p>And they couldn't, of course, afford it to move and bring her here with the
child, not having a job and apartment, so I suggested, "Why don't you move to my
house while he is in Dallas until he finds a job, and then you can move?" So
that's what they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Marina moved to your house while Oswald was in Dallas looking
for a job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us approximately when Marina moved to your
house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. It was in the first week in October. I don't know exactly when it
was, but it was the first week in October, sometime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I understand that you helped Marina move from the apartment
in Fort Worth to your house in a pickup truck that you borrowed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; Patterson had a pickup truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did anybody else help you, or just you and Marina did the
moving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Lee still was there, so when we moved, he went to Dallas that
night, that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there anybody besides you and Marina and Lee that helped
you with the moving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; nobody else. They didn't have nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There wasn't very much to move?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; the baby was sleeping in a suitcase. And then the first time
when George <span class="locked">went&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. George Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. He saw this situation. He bought a little bed for the child and
a couple of other things. He helped them very much. He was very nice about
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald seem to appreciate what Mr. Bouhe was doing
for him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I don't think so. He didn't appreciate nothing, never. In fact,
when she moved to my house one weekend on Saturday, I don't remember when,
George Bouhe came and he brought a big carton of all kinds of groceries and
vitamins for the baby and everything, so Lee came and he asked Marina, "Who
brought all these groceries?" And he saw in the <span class="locked">kitchen&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was while Marina was living at your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. While she was, yes. And said, "George Bouhe has bought," and
he was real mad at him. He said, "You are living in her house, you are not
living in his house. Why he brings groceries?" He was just strange man,
I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During the time that Marina lived at your house, did you purchase
all the groceries and similar items for Marina and the child except for
what Mr. Bouhe brought?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, nobody else would do it. She was living in my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald made no contributions whatsoever for the support of
the family at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he offer to contribute?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us about how long Marina lived in your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, she lived, I said in the first week in October they moved, she
moved there. And then I had an accident in the middle of October and I stayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
in the hospital 10 days. When I got out from the hospital, I think it was in the
end of October, after my accident, I stayed home, I think, 3 or 4 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was Marina there at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; she was there. Then I went to New York on the 31st of
October. I went to New York, and when I came back on the 15th, they were
gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know exactly when they moved out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether Oswald lived in your house with Marina
at any time that you were gone to New York or in the hospital?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. That&mdash;not that I know. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss that with Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I saw her after that time. I saw her only on Christmas one day
and Easter, and it was real short visit, so we didn't talk about the past.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know where Oswald lived at first when he moved to
Dallas from Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, I heard that he lived in YMCA.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who told you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I heard from two friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember who particularly told you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes, Mrs. Clark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mrs. Max Clark?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes. And I think George Bouhe told me, or at least George Bouhe
suggested him to stay in YMCA.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know of any other place that Oswald might have
lived when he first went to Dallas other than the YMCA?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you then visit the Oswald's apartment on Elsbeth at any
time in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; one time we went. First time on Christmas Day. She
borrowed my sewing machine, and on the first day of Christmas I bought a
little toy for the baby and we went to visit them and I thought I bring my
sewing machine but she said she wasn't finished with the sewing machine. So
we went the first day of Easter again. John's parents lived in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Mother and father, they live here. And we went the second time
and I brought the sewing machine. That was only twice I saw them after
they moved from my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know whether or not Marina used the sewing machine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see her using it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I didn't see her using it, but after that when I brought it,
I opened it and saw all this, she had probable difficulty with the stitches, and
there is pieces of something in there, and she just sewing on it, and I just
closed it and I never did touch it again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see any clothes that Marina made with the sewing
machine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. She didn't make any clothes. But the clothes that friends of
mine gave to her, lots of clothes, she was trying to alter them and things like
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina know how to use the sewing machine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; I think. She told me she could. I never did see her sewing,
but she said she could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. About the time that Marina lived in your house, did you
understand that the Oswalds were having any marital difficulties?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, I think she was stubborn, and he was just cruel to her,
and they would argue for nothing, just nothing. And he would beat her all
the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Beat her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Oh, yes. In fact, first time when she came to my house with
George Bouhe, she had black and blue over half of her face and I didn't ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
at that time, but after she moved in my house, I said, Marina, what was on
your face? And she told me that he beat her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The first time that Marina came to your house, can you
remember exactly when that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. In July. Sometime in July.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you noticed even in July that she had been bruised, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But it wasn't until October or <span class="locked">November&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. October when she moved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That you learned that she had gotten those bruises as a result
of her husband beating her, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At the time in October that Marina lived in your house, did
she discuss with you her marital relations with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes. Well, she is, I think she is very nice girl. And I told her,
"Marina, you are in such a difficult financial situation, you'd better not have
children for quite a while, and when you have a better financial situation, you
can have them." And she said, "Well, I don't know."</p>

<p>And I told her, "If you want to, I have a lady doctor, Dr. Taylor. If you
want me, I will take you there. She will give you some things." And she
said, "No; I don't think so."</p>

<p>She said, "Our married life is so strange that I don't think I ever will have
any children any more," because he was very cold to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina indicate at that time that she and Oswald did
not have normal sexual relations.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Very seldom. The thing that she told me, "Very seldom."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell me everything that you can remember about that subject
that Marina told you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. That was the only thing that was worrying me, her to not have
children, because they are in such bad shape, and that is the only thing she
told me.</p>

<p>And I said, "If you think you want any more." So it is none of my business,
you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that all that Marina said about that subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. We didn't talk any more, because it was my suggestion to her to
not have children, and she told me that, and that was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she ever tell you that Oswald would&mdash;was not very much
of a man in that sense?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes. That is what she told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. They very seldom had sexual relations?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss that question with her any other time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form an impression as to how Lee and Marina were
getting along with each other at the time that Marina lived in your house,
other than what we have already talked about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No. Couple of times I told her, "Why do you argue with him
about little things," and she said, "Oh, because he is not a man." That is what
she told me. For instance, I like hot peppers and he didn't like it. Well, is
nothing wrong with a man who doesn't like peppers. John doesn't like it at
all. And at the table they were eating, and I ate the peppers, and he wouldn't
touch, and she said, "He is afraid of everything, hot peppers."</p>

<p>And he said, he don't like it, and they had argument about that. And after
he left I said, Marina, you shouldn't do that because, well, some people like
them and some don't."</p>

<p>Well, things like that, she would start with him and they had an argument.
Probably if I wouldn't be there, they would have a fight or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever have the feeling that Marina was a good wife
to Oswald, or did you have the feeling that she was not particularly a good
wife?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, she is a little bit lazy one, and she can sleep 48 hours a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
day. That is the only thing. And maybe they had trouble because of this and
little things, like I said about the peppers and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever see or hear of Marina making fun of Oswald in
front of other people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Marina making fun of Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Oh, yes; she would do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of any specific examples?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. She always was complaining about him. He was not a man. He
is afraid. I don't know, not complete, I guess, or something like that. Not
complete man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This may not seem to be too important, but we are not just
curious, it might have a bearing on the Commission's determination of what
kind of man Oswald was and what kind of person he was.</p>

<p>Did Marina make fun of Oswald's sexual inability in front of other people,
or was it a more general thing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Generally. I never heard sexual nothing; no. Only when I asked
her about this, she told me. And that was, we don't talk any more about this.
I didn't hear it. Maybe somebody else did. I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You had the feeling, I gather from what you said, that if there
were difficulties in the Oswald marriage, they were not entirely Lee Oswald's
fault? It also would be some of the fault of Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your opinion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I think that she is stubborn, real stubborn, and she would pick
up something little and go on and have an argument for nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear them argue about politics?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No, sir; I never did discuss politics because I saw the Marx books
and everything on his table, and I never did even go to a conversation with
him. But sometimes I would ask her, "How is life in Russia?"</p>

<p>And well, she would tell me that nothing, in what you go to the restaurant,
and they don't have food, and things like that and he would get mad at her.
"That is not true. They have everything." And so on. And she would tell, I
guess, the truth, and he wouldn't like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald sometimes expressed a more favorable view of life in
Russia than Marina did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that a common thing for them to argue about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, they didn't argue, but when I was asking questions, she
would tell the truth, and he would say, "No; that is not true in Russia. It is
better" something. Not all the people <span class="locked">think&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned these books that you saw in Oswald's apartment.
Do you remember any specific names of these books or magazines that
you saw?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I don't, but I know some of them belonged to the downtown
library, Fort Worth Library.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember whether these books related to particular
subject matter? Were they books about Marxism and that sort of thing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You do remember that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; I remember one of the books was real thick and black, I
think. I don't remember any names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't remember the specific names of any of the books?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you speak Russian, Mrs. Hall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever talk to Lee Oswald in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. All the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form an opinion of his ability to use the Russian
language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Very good. I think he talked very good Russian. He could read
and write and everything. And he, in fact, a few times I told him, I said,
Lee, why don't you speak in English with Marina and let her learn English?"</p>

<p>And he said, "No. Then I am forgetting my Russian." I said, "You don't
need the Russian language now in the United States. She needs English."</p>

<p>And he said, "No, I won't." He never will talk English to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you also speak to Marina in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What kind of command of Russian did she have? How well
could she speak Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was she better able to speak Russian than Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But in your opinion, Lee did have a good command of the
Russian language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Very good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it grammatically correct, would you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is your own command of the Russian language good, would
you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I thought it was good, and I think it is good, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What language did you learn as a child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that was the first language you spoke, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. We spoke Russian in our home, and I was in French school.
Then I was in Russian school again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You also speak French?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your language in Iran? Iranian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Armenian. And I <span class="locked">think&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you speak Turkish?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Turkish a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever try to speak to Marina Oswald in English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I never did. I wasn't so long with her to try to teach her
something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It was quite clear to you, was it, that Marina could not speak
English at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; she could understand a little bit what the conversations was
about, if I was talking to somebody. But she couldn't understand all little
things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now you first met Marina, you say, in approximately July of
1962. Did you have an opinion as to how much English she could understand
at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, I think it was the same thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She didn't seem to learn too much English as time went on,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, George Bouhe tried to teach her, and he brought her books
and things like that. And once a week or twice a week she was sending her
homework or something to him. He would correct her and sometimes, on a
weekend, he would come and teach her more. That was all that I know that
she has of English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know Mr. Peter Gregory?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; I know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know his son, Paul?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I never met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina ever speak of Paul Gregory to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know Gary Taylor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes. Well, one time Lee, while Marina was in my house&mdash;in
fact, I just came out from the hospital accident&mdash;this Gary Taylor and his wife,
they brought Lee. It was on Sunday. They brought him to Fort Worth, and
then they went back together, Lee Oswald and the Taylors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Gary Taylor's wife at that time was the daughter of George
De Mohrenschildt, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know Mr. De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; I met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know him well, or are you a casual acquaintance of
his?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I saw him altogether maybe three or four times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever talk to De Mohrenschildt about Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I don't think I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know whether De Mohrenschildt was a close friend
of Oswald's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes. Some friends told me again that they are very close with
Lee Oswald. Well, in 1 week, because they couldn't go nowhere and didn't
have a car, and De Mohrenschildt came for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever see Oswald drive an automobile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No. In fact, one time I asked Oswald. I said, talking something
about the car, and I said, asked him, "Can you drive a car?" And he
said, "No".</p>

<p>I said "How come?"</p>

<p>He said, "Well, I just can't." And I said, "Every kid in high school can
drive a car. How come you can't?"</p>

<p>And he said, "Well, I just can't."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear of Oswald learning how to drive a car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned previously that Mr. Bouhe asked you if you
could help in getting Marina's teeth fixed. Do you know whether Marina ever
did get her teeth fixed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, she needed a few teeth extracted, and George Bouhe made
an appointment for her here in Baylor. And the few times she came&mdash;and extracted
them and came back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina ever tell you who paid for this work to be done?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; she did not tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know who paid for it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No. Maybe George Bouhe did, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever have any discussions with Marina about religion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes. While she was in my house, she asked one time, she said,
"Elena. I want to baptize my baby." She said, "Well, I was baptized. My
grandmother baptized me, but when I talk about religion and baptize, he don't
want to even hear it, so how about baptizing the baby." And I called Father
Dimitri here in Dallas, and it is Greek Orthodox Church, and I told him the
situation and who they are, and she wanted baby baptized. And he said, that is
fine, so I took her one night, her and the baby, and we&mdash;I am a godmother of
the child. And, of course, when Lee found it out, it was too late already, and
he, of course, didn't like it at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember anything, specifically that he said about
that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No. Marina told me when I saw her at Christmas&mdash;I asked her,
and she said, of course, he didn't like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned before that at Christmastime in 1962, you went
over to Oswald's apartment in Dallas, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who was there at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Me, Marina, and the child&mdash;Lee&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember what the discussion was at that time? What
did you talk about? Do you have any recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, when we went in, they didn't have any Christmas tree, no
nothing. And I looked and I said, "Where is your Christmas tree?" And Lee
said, "What Christmas tree?" And I said, "Well, everybody has a Christmas
tree." And Lee said, "No; we don't have Christmas tree."</p>

<p>Then John started to talk with him about religion. I think it was Christmastime,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
yes; and then he said that it is just commercialized, a commercialized
holiday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember what your husband said in response to that
remark by Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; but I don't remember whether it was at that time or at
Easter when John talked with him and said, "Well, we sometimes come to
Dallas to go to church. If you want to, they will come and&mdash;we will come
and take you with us." And he said, "No; not me. If Marina wants, she can
go with you."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald indicated that he himself did not care to go to Church?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. He said no; he wouldn't, but if Marina wants, he didn't believe in
nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina ever go to church with you and your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; she never did go. Well, I never did see them after Easter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know after Marina moved out of your house where she
went?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, I guess they had an apartment at Elsbeth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As far as you know, they moved to an apartment on Elsbeth
Street, and she stayed there with Lee until subsequently Lee moved around the
corner to an apartment on Neely Street, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes. The first time when we went there on Christmas, we went
to Elsbeth. And the second time the landlord told me that they moved a couple
of blocks from it, so we went there on Eastertime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear that Marina moved out of the apartment on
Elsbeth Street shortly after she returned to Lee and shortly after she moved
out of your house and went to live with a friend of hers in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I think they had an argument and she left one night and she went,
I think, to Meller's house and she stayed there. That is everything I hear. I
don't know exactly, but through a friend you just hear things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't have any direct knowledge of that instance?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I mean I wasn't in touch with them at all, never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let's go back to the time that you went to Oswald's apartment
at Christmastime. Do you remember anything else that was discussed at that
time, or have you given us your best recollection as to what the conversation was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. With him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; with him or with Marina.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. John was asking him a question, how does he like his work. And
does he learn something. And sometimes he can go into business for himself.
And so he said, "No; I never think that I will go to business for myself."</p>

<p>And he said something about security, I don't have any security here on my
job. I don't know if I am still there another week or so. And he said something
about Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did that seem to concern Oswald that he didn't know how long
he was going to have his job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; he was concerned about that. And he said in Russia you
don't have to worry about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald indicate that he wanted to go to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; well, he never did say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you get the impression that he had a desire to return to the
Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; I think if he would have money, he would go back, but she
never did want to go back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did she tell you about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, I was telling her&mdash;she said the life is so bad there. Bad
in a way like they don't have luxuries that they have here. They don't have
grocery stores like here and things like that. She missed her&mdash;she don't have
relatives&mdash;I think she has only, I mean she don't have parents, but she has
relatives, and she says, "Sometimes I miss them but I wouldn't like to go back
and live."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She never at anytime indicated any desire to return to Russia;
is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. In fact, I had the impression that she married him only to just
get out from that place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you get that impression?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, I don't know, because I don't think she ever loved him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What makes you say that, Mrs. Hall? What do you base that
statement on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, because they had arguments from the time they were married,
I think, and the little things she said, and seems like she never did
like him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she ever tell you specifically that she married Oswald to
come to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; she never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss this question with your friend as to whether
or not Marina married him to get to come to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I think I mentioned to somebody. I don't remember who.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think that was a generally held opinion then, in the
Russian community in Dallas that that was one of the reasons why Marina
married Oswald, or do you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I don't know what they thought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned that on Easter you went to the Oswalds to take
a gift to the baby, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who was there at that time? Just Lee and Marina and the
baby and yourself and your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you recall what the conversations were between you at
that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, it was about church again. John said, "if you want, we
will take you." Not much at all. We didn't stay very long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was any&mdash;was there any further conversation about Oswald's
job or desire to go back to Russia that you can remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, about job. While John and Lee were talking, Marina told,
"Did he tell you?" And I said, "Tell me what?" She said that he lost his job.
And I said, "No, he didn't tell me." She said, "One of those things." "He never
tells anybody about himself." And then I found out he lost his job. He is not
working any more. And I said, "What are you doing all day long?" And her
face was rather, she had sunburn. "Where did you get that sunburn?" "Well,
all day we go fish." There was a little bitty place on Elsbeth Street, and she
said, "We just fish all day and eat trout. Fish and eat."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald was not working at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; he wasn't working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know where he worked in Dallas when he had a job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. He was in kind of picture printing company, or I don't know,
printing pictures or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, have you told us, to the best of your recollection, all the
conversation that occurred at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was the last time you saw Lee Oswald, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You subsequently learned, however, that they had moved to
New Orleans, Mrs. Hall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I didn't know it. I heard it again that they moved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember who told you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I think Mrs. Max Clark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you subsequently have a discussion with your husband
about the fact that the Oswald's had left for New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; I think I mentioned to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember what he said and what you said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I don't think we said anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember what your husband told you when you heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
that Oswald had gone to New Orleans, that your husband, John, thought that
Oswald was on his way back to Russia, that he had gone to New Orleans to
take passage on a ship to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't have any recollection of that conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I don't. I heard all these things from Mrs. Clark, because
she is more in touch with the people here in Dallas. She comes more often to
Dallas to see George Bouhe, and we were not very much. We don't see him
very much, these Russian people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever have any political conversations with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form an opinion as to Oswald's political views?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was that opinion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. That he is a Communist and nobody can change him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You formed that opinion because of books and literature that
you had seen in his house and things that other people told you about him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes. If the man went to Russia and came back, he should have
learned his lesson, I guess. When he came back, he should know that here
is a better place, but still he was thinking about Russia. And I was raised in
a very anti-Communist family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you didn't have much sympathy with Oswald's attitude?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; none at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina ever tell you that she wanted to move to Dallas
because she heard there were English classes held at the YMCA?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did she tell you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, I guess while she was living in my house; or no, it was
before that time. Well, George Bouhe told her that they had classes here in
Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever ask Marina whether she had gone to any of these
classes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes. The first time when I saw her at Christmas, I asked her,
and she said, "No; how can I go. He won't babysit at night, and I have to take
bus to go downtown." And she couldn't do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know Jack Ruby or Jack Rubenstein?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know of any connection between Oswald and Rubenstein
or Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I don't. In fact, at that time they never talked about his
mother, Marguerite Oswald, and I had the impression that Marina had never
met her, because she never mentioned to me. She told me that they live in
Oswald's brother's house for a week or so before they found this apartment in
Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But Marina never mentioned Lee's mother to you at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No. And I had that impression that she is not in Texas, something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You later learned from reading the newspaper that Marguerite
Oswald did live in Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you never heard Lee Oswald mention his mother at any
time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No. He never would talk. He would just sit there and look, or
if he had something to read, he would read.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he read quite a bit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; I think he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any way of forming an opinion as to what he did
with his time when he wasn't at work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. He was lying on the floor or on the couch and reading.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He didn't have any other outside activity that he had other
than his work?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned the fact that he had done some fishing at the
little pond in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. That is when he didn't have any job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know Mr. Alexander Kleinlerer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes. He was coming to my house while John and I were divorced.
That was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I said, that was all he was coming, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Mr. Kleinlerer tell you that during the time that you were
in the hospital and subsequently when you were in New York, that he came to
the house to see how Marina was and how she was getting along?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes. He didn't tell me, but Mrs. Clark told me, because when I
came back from New York, John was in Fort Worth already, and we got married
after 2 days and I didn't see him any more. I didn't see this Kleinlerer any
more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you ever seen him since then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You had no discussions yourself with Kleinlerer about what
Marina was doing or who was at the house while you were gone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No. Mrs. Clark told me that sometime he would take Marina to
grocery store, and sometimes she would take her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did you make arrangements to pay for these groceries for
Marina while you were in the hospital and you were in New York? Did you
give her money, or did you have a charge account at the grocery store, or something
like that? What was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I didn't give her money that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did she get groceries during the time that you were gone
to New York and during the time that you were in the hospital, do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I don't know. Maybe Mrs. Clark or Mr. Kleinlerer paid for her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you yourself did not pay for any of her groceries?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But during the time that you and Marina both were living at
the house, you paid for the groceries, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long did both you and Marina live in the house together?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, I guess 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That you were actually together in the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes. But I was working all the time. And in fact&mdash;that time
when she was in my house, sometimes I stayed for overtime. I worked overtime
at nights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you doing work as a dental technician at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During the time that you knew the Oswalds and these various
meetings that you had with them, did you discuss with them the reasons as to
why Lee Oswald went to Russia in the first place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss with either one of them, or were you
present at a discussion where he told anybody what kind of a job he had in
Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. He was working in some kind of factory, I think. I don't remember,
really. I never did talk about this with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't remember that he told you or anybody when you
were there, how much he was paid in the factory, do you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, I think 80 rubles, Russian rubles, I think. Well, I don't
know. I think she had 80 rubles. He had a little bit more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was while Marina worked, too?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald say that he had any other source of income when
he was in Russia from any source other than his job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever tell you, or did you ever hear that he received
help from the Red Cross while he was in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I never heard of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever mention any hunting trips that he had gone on
when he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I don't know. He never did mention it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have no recollection of having heard him speak of such a
thing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No. I never spoke with him very much, because I think we were
allergic to each other. He didn't like me and I didn't like him at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever see a gun of any kind in any of their possessions?
You said that you moved them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never knew them to own a firearm of any type, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina tell you anything about her youth in Russia, where
she lived and what kind of things she did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Not very much, really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you that she had been born in Leningrad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; she told me she was living in Leningrad and then moved to
Minsk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you why she moved?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear from anybody else why she moved?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss with the Oswalds the reason why they
returned to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, because I think he changed his mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know any specific reasons that made him change his
mind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it seem strange to you that the Oswalds could leave Russia
and come back to the United States together like they did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; it was kind of strange.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss that with the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss it with anybody else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, once when they came to Fort Worth, it was all over the
papers, you know, and like we Russians, we just want to know. I mean, we
read the paper, and Oswald tried to call a few people, and I called Mrs.
Clark, and she didn't know what to do, and we don't know.</p>

<p>Is it good or bad, really, for us to get in touch with them? So finally John or
George Bouhe got in touch with them, and I told Mrs. Clark and all the Russians
told probably, it is okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, did you ever have any discussion with these Russian
people as to the apparent ease with which Oswald was able to leave the Soviet
Union and come back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. It wasn't very easy. I read in the paper that it took him over a
year. Well, he was a year, 1 year in Russia, he started asking to come back and
it took him almost 2 years, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is something you read in the paper after the assassination,
isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I think it was in the paper at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When they came back from Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recall any conversations with any of your Russian
friends that you had, or anybody else, about this question of Oswald's return
to the United States and the fact that Marina was permitted to leave Russia
and come with him? I don't want you to remember anything that didn't happen,
but if you do have a recollection of it, I would like to have it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, I think I talked with Mrs. Clark about that, and we thought
it strange how come they let Marina come, so that was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever have any discussions with any of these people
before the assassination as to whether or not Oswald might be a Russian agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it ever occur to you prior to the assassination that Oswald
might be a Russian agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I really don't know. It is such a hard question. Only one thing
I could tell, that he was such a quiet and such a&mdash;I don't know how to express
myself&mdash;person, that I never thought he could do something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Like shoot the President, you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it ever occur to you prior to the time of the assassination
that he was dangerous or mentally unstable in any way, did it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you surprised when you heard that he had been arrested
in connection with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Very much so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any conversations with your friends about it
then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. In fact, when I was watching TV and I saw all the shooting,
after a few minutes Mrs. Clark called me and said, "Elena, did you hear? Lee
Oswald&mdash;Did you hear Lee Oswald's name?"</p>

<p>I said "No." She said, "I heard it on the radio, and I think it was Lee Oswald's
name."</p>

<p>And I couldn't believe it. After an hour or so, they told that it was Lee
Oswald, and everybody was very surprised.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say that most all of your friends in the Russian group
were very surprised that Oswald was involved in this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever express within your hearing, or did you ever
hear him having expressed resentment against the U.S. Government for any
reason?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever express resentment that it had taken a long time
for him to come back to the United States after he decided to return from
Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear him mention President Kennedy or talk
about President Kennedy in any way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How about Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever mention Richard Nixon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never heard of any displeasure that Oswald might have
had with Mr. Nixon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What about General Walker, did you ever hear any discussion
about him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Think about it now. Do you think of anything now, Mrs. Hall,
that you can remember about the Oswalds about your relationship with them,
that you think the Commission should know about that I haven't already asked
you about? Can you think of anything that you should add at this point?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I wish I knew more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You think we pretty well covered everything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; that is all, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have no more questions at this point. Thank you very much,
Mrs. Hall.</p>

<h2 id="t406"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_JOHN_RAYMOND_HALL" id="TESTIMONY_OF_JOHN_RAYMOND_HALL">TESTIMONY OF JOHN RAYMOND HALL</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of John Raymond Hall was taken at 4 p.m., on March 24, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you rise, please, and I will swear you in. Do you
solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth in the testimony that you are about to give?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Hall, my name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am a member of
the legal staff of the President's Commission to investigate the assassination of
President Kennedy. I have been authorized to take your testimony by the
Commission pursuant to authority granted to it by Executive Order 11130,
dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution of Congress 137.</p>

<p>Copies of those two documents and also of the Commission's Rules of procedure
governing the taking of testimony have been sent to you, I believe, in
a letter from Mr. Rankin in which he indicated that I would contact you this
week to take your testimony.</p>

<p>Have you received copies of those documents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We want to examine you briefly concerning whatever knowledge
you might have of Lee Harvey Oswald as a result of contacts that you had
with him after his return from the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. So that this doesn't overlap what my wife would say, would you
like for me to just completely eliminate anything except when just he and I
were together, or would you, if it overlaps, does it make any difference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I think I want you to tell generally the contacts that you had
with Oswald, but I will bring that out. What is your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. John Raymond Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. 4760 Trail Lake Drive, Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your employment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Self-employed. Dental laboratory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Crown &amp; Bridge Prosthesis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are a native born American?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Birmingham, Ala.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you move to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I was born in 1928 and moved in approximately 1931.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you move to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I beg your pardon, I moved to Garland. From Birmingham to
Garland in 1931. And in 1946, we moved to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Then did you move to Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Then I went into the service after going to college in 1948. And
then in 1956&mdash;in 1955, the latter part of 1955, I moved to Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. 1928.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. 1928?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your wife's name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Elena Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When were you married to Mrs. Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. In 1959. September the 11th, 1959.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Am I correct in understanding that you were subsequently
divorced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Then you were subsequently remarried?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When were you remarried?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. In November of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did there come a time when you made the acquaintance of
Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us the circumstances surrounding that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. The first time was during the latter part of these marital difficulties
with my wife whom I was divorced with at the time.</p>

<p>I had started my business in Odessa, Tex., and I believe this was in about
August of 1962, when I was making many trips from Odessa to Fort Worth,
for the purpose of seeing my wife. And the first time, I believe it was in
August of 1962, that I met Oswald, was about&mdash;when I made one of these weekend
trips. I came in on Friday night or Saturday, and she, through her
friends, mostly foreign born, George Bouhe and Gali Clark, although Gali
wasn't involved in <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your wife was born in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. She was born in Tehran, Iran. Her mother and father were born
in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Does your wife speak Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; her mother and father moved to Iran when they were in
their middle 20's, so actually my wife is Iranian.</p>

<p>All right, then when I met Oswald is on one of these weekend trips. As I
understood my wife when I came in that weekend, this ex-GI and ex-marine
and his Russian-born wife have some difficulties along the line of finding jobs
and so forth, and getting along. We went over to their apartment near Montgomery
Ward in Fort Worth with George Bouhe, and I forget the people's
names, they were over there from Dallas&mdash;De Mohrenschildt's daughter and
her husband, I believe that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would that be Gary and Alexandra Taylor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; we discussed what was going to happen, and in this Oswald
was going to move to Dallas and try to locate a job. In the meantime, since
my business was in Odessa, financial difficulties they already were having,
Marina would move in with my wife and live there while Oswald came to Dallas
and got a job and got himself settled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember whether Oswald had any job at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. At that time he did not have a job, and George Bouhe and I
discussed this.</p>

<p>That afternoon I called my father, who is with the Murray Gin Co. here
in Dallas, because they have a machine shop and such. Oswald told me that
he worked in sheet-metal work in Russia, and so I called dad, and dad said
that he didn't think they had anything. And I told George Bouhe that if he
would check with personnel in the morning&mdash;that was on Saturday&mdash;if he
would check with them on Monday morning and see, we would like to give
this guy a job.</p>

<p>It turned out that George called my father and dad talked to the personnel
manager and there wasn't anything available at the Murray Co. Then through
hearsay, actually Oswald came to Dallas and got a job through the Texas Employment
Commission, and that was that for the time being.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember who told you that Oswald got a job through
the Texas Employment Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. George Bouhe, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you went to Oswald's apartment in Fort Worth this
first time with Bouhe and the other people that you mentioned, did you then
meet Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you speak to him, and did he speak to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; we talked at length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell me generally what he said and what you talked
about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Maybe it is the whole pattern, but he had just gotten back from
downtown Fort Worth, walking. On the way over there my wife was telling
me how destitute they were. This was my first impression.</p>

<p>So when I walked in, he had just been to town to buy this 50-cent magazine
on Russia, which of course I thought, to myself, here they are destitute and
he is spending 50 cents on a magazine, especially about Russia.</p>

<p>We visited that afternoon. We were there for an hour or so, and nothing
really important was said, that I can think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you about his trip to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Not a whole lot at this time. We were sort of impressed by his
trip to Russia. The emphasis was on getting him moved to Dallas and getting
him a job, so actually that was the main concern and talk at that time, and
most of it really went on by George Bouhe and myself and this Taylor fellow.</p>

<p>Do you mind if I smoke?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Certainly not.</p>

<p>Go right ahead.</p>

<p>Did you and Oswald at any time ever discuss his trip to Russia in any detail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell me approximately when that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; the first time which wasn't really much in detail, several
weeks later my wife had an automobile accident and I flew in from Odessa on
Wednesday or Thursday morning.</p>

<p>I believe she had the accident on Wednesday, and I flew in on Thursday morning.
I went straight to the hospital and saw she was all right, and spent most
of the day there.</p>

<p>And because Marina was staying at our home at that time, and this was the
period during the divorce, I stayed in a motel, the Landmark Lounge.</p>

<p>The next couple of days Gali Clark, Mrs. Max Clark, took me by the house
to get some clothes or something, where I was there just a few minutes and
only Marina was there. That was the only contact I had with Marina, Thursday
or Friday.</p>

<p>Then Oswald was in Dallas during this period of time on Saturday, and I
was going back and forth from the motel to the hospital.</p>

<p>Then on Saturday Oswald came over, and his wife, who was staying at our
house, as I mentioned, Marina fixed borsch, Russian soup, for Mr. and Mrs.
Clark, Lee Oswald, and myself, and I ran out from the hospital and ate with
them.</p>

<p>And during this period of time we had gotten on this thing about Russia
a little bit, Max and Oswald and myself, and the conversation was really led
by Max.</p>

<p>He was questioning Oswald as to the whole pattern, the whole system of
government, the way it was really operated, as to the communistic principles
and how jobs were secured and how people lived, and so forth.</p>

<p>This was about all that was said there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did the question come up as to why Oswald went to Russia
in the first place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Not then. At this time I just ran out and ate soup, and they
were still in conversation when I left to go back to the hospital, so I only stayed
possibly an hour. Maybe 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss with Oswald, or ever participate in a discussion
in which the question as to why he went to Russia came up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Just generally. The next time I saw Oswald after&mdash;this was the
car wreck; then my wife and I went to New York, and then we came back and
we remarried November 17, I believe&mdash;we didn't see Oswald again until Christmas
when my wife fixed a little present, I think, for the baby and we came to
Dallas, and we had been to church, it seems like. I think we spent the night
at the Cabana Motel and went to church at the Greek Orthodox Church, St.
Stephens, and then visited them on Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>Wait a minute, no, I am talking about Christmas. That would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
during the week&mdash;anyway, we came over and visited them at Christmas time
and brought the little baby girl, June, a Christmas present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember where Oswald lived then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; over in Oak Cliff at the first location in Oak Cliff, Elsbeth
Street. I believe it was on the corner in the red apartments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At that time did you discuss with them the reasons as to why
he went to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. At this time, being Christmas and so, and I am not real strongly
religious&mdash;I mean not to any extreme, but I have my firm beliefs, and I believe
in God and the fundamentals of our Christianity&mdash;I am a Baptist&mdash;I mentioned
to Oswald&mdash;this is what touched the whole thing off&mdash;they didn't have a Christmas
tree. We wondered why, because you can buy a Christmas tree for 39
cents, probably a little one, and my wife, I think, asked why they didn't have
a Christmas tree, and Oswald said he didn't want a Christmas tree, that he
didn't believe in this sort of thing, that it was commercialized, and so forth.</p>

<p>When he mentioned this, it got me interested in his thinking. This was
actually the first time I think that&mdash;this is the third time that I saw him&mdash;I think
this was the first time I felt he was odd, because when he crossed me on religion,
I mean just general religion, not anything specific&mdash;when he crossed me on religion,
then I was offended mentally.</p>

<p>I might not have seemed that way&mdash;I didn't get mad or anything, but I didn't
like it, and I asked him about, since he didn't have a car, I asked him if Elena,
when we went to the Greek Orthodox Church here in Dallas, if we might stop
by and pick him up and take him with us.</p>

<p>And he said, "Oh, no, he didn't believe in Christianity, that this Marxism,
Leninism, this book, whatever the name it <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he have a book there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I didn't see it if he did. He had a lot of Russian literature, I
saw, but I never really thumbed through it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any specific books or periodicals that he had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I really don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, we differed on religion. So then he told Elena that he
didn't believe in Christianity and so forth, he said, "If you want to come by
and pick up Marina and take her to church, that is all right, but I am not
going to go."</p>

<p>About that time we left. The conversation wasn't interesting, and we had
gone over to take this little present to the baby, and we had accomplished the
purpose, so we left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When was it that you discussed with Oswald the reasons why
he went to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. The next time was Easter, if I am getting all this straight. I hadn't
been in business long for myself. I was real strong for the system of free enterprise,
and I asked Oswald how he was getting along down at the printing
place, and he said, "Well, he was doing as well as could be expected, except
the fact was that he didn't have security in his job and didn't like the whole
setup."</p>

<p>And I wondered why. And he said, "He didn't have security."</p>

<p>And I told him, "Well, nobody has security actually. We have to work and
keep up with what is going on and keep getting ahead, and that it seemed
to me like he could stay down there for 2 or 3 or 4 years and learn what had
to be learned and open his own shop, and that he would be bettering himself
and making more money and having more niceties of life.</p>

<p>And so the point is, with this system of free enterprise which I was real
strong for, because I was trying to get ahead, and so Oswald, he told me that
he was, he had already been discontent with the United States, that he didn't
have security, and he really didn't know where his next job was coming from,
and he heard through these theories that everything was controlled by the
State in Russia, and that that was the reason he wanted to go, so to speak,
and that is about it, inasfar as he was just unhappy with all of our systems.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate to you that he had any desire to return to
Russia?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; and even at this time&mdash;in fact, I don't remember, I don't
know, it was probably at Easter, he said that he wanted to go back.</p>

<p>And I know this to be real definite that&mdash;I don't know how you want that&mdash;because
when we first heard, when my wife and I first heard from the Clarks
that Oswald was in New Orleans, when he was down there word got back, I
don't know how it got back, but the Clarks told us he was in New Orleans, and
when we found this out, I told my wife that I knew that he was down there
to catch a ship and go to Russia.</p>

<p>So I don't know how he said this, but he left the impression with me, or told
me directly&mdash;I think it was more directly, because I know at that time he wanted
to go back to Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have a recollection that he said that to you in so many
words?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; I am sure of this, because my wife, when Gali Clark told
her, and we found out he was in New Orleans, I was sure he was on his way
to Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think he told you that at the time you met him at
Easter of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; because this is really what impressed me on religion, but
things got stormy in this Easter meeting. I pushed him a little bit harder at
that time than I had before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he talk to you about his experiences in Russia during the
time that he had previously been there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; he explained to us about living in Minsk, about working in
the sheet metal factory, about how food was rather short, and about the terrible
expense of shoes and clothes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you how much money he was paid at the factory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Max Clark asked him this at this soup luncheon, and I really
don't remember. I have read this in the newspapers, but I don't remember
what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate to you in any way that he was receiving income
while he was in Russia from any source other than his job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you about any hunting trips that he might have
gone on in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know that Oswald owned a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss with him any aspect of hunting or the
use of firearms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't speak Russian, do you, Mr. Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No, sir; this was a big disagreement at the first time we met. I
know I just didn't enter into the discussion, so it was just about not wanting
to teach his wife English. I was really upset about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you why he didn't want his wife to learn English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. He wanted to perfect his Russian. He thought it more important
for him to further himself in the Russian language than for her to learn English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form an opinion as to whether or not Marina Oswald
did understand any English, or to what extent she understood English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. All the time, every meeting we had, I didn't feel like she could
understand anything further than hello.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You first met them, as you said, in Fort Worth in the fall of
1962, and the last time you saw them was at Easter of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you maintain that opinion about Marina's ability to use
English throughout that entire time, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever express any resentment against the U.S. Government
for any reason that you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Not specifically. Just feeling. Like on capitalism, and I don't
know if this is related to the time Max Clark and I were together with Oswald,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
and I don't know, Oswald didn't say this, somebody told me like George Bouhe,
that Oswald felt&mdash;and we are just middle-income people&mdash;but he felt he didn't
like us, because he felt like we were true capitalists, and that was just because
we had a television set in the bedroom and one in the living room.</p>

<p>This was bitter to him. He didn't like that fact and didn't like electric
can openers and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He expressed that, a general resentment of the social system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear him say anything about President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What about Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever tell you why he decided to come back to the United
States and leave Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I really don't think so. The only reason I hesitate there is because,
of course I read this in the paper, but he was talking about wanting to
go back to Russia, and again I say I am not sure that he told me directly that
he wanted to go back to Russia, either Christmas or Easter, or both because
it was so firm in my mind that he wanted to go back to Russia.</p>

<p>And after I read in the papers that after he had only been to Russia about
a year, he was trying to come back to the United States, I wondered why.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But he never did tell you, and you never asked him about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever form an opinion about Oswald during the time
that you knew him, based on your acquaintance with him and the times that
you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, the first time we met him of course we all thought he was
so-called egghead, or whatever words you want to use.</p>

<p>And I am sure that if it hadn't been for the fact that we had feelings for
his wife, we felt sorry for them because some friends of ours gave my wife some
clothes to give to Marina, and, of course, wanted to help her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Mrs. I.&nbsp;J. Flere. She gave some clothes, and I don't know, I think
there were several people. My wife would know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Gave clothes to Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; as well as George Bouhe. I think he gave $10 or $15 to
my wife to buy some groceries for her and these things happen where people
contributed to help. But I think I formed an opinion of him the first 5 minutes
I met him when he came back from town with this magazine, because I couldn't
figure wasting the money on literature. I had a definite opinion, and it got
worse and worse, and the only reason we went back Christmas and Easter was
because the baby, Elena wanted to take her an Easter bunny.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't as of then like Oswald particularly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think he was mentally unstable in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I never really thought of this at the time. Looking back on it
now, he was certainly abnormal, in the way we are raised.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you had no thoughts at the time before the assassination
that he was mentally unstable in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never regarded him as being a dangerous individual in
any respect, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you really consider or question, or you just never thought
of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Just never thought of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of any other thing that you might know about
Oswald as a result of your acquaintance with him that your wife wouldn't
know, that you think you should tell us about at this point? I am correct
in understanding, am I not, that your wife is really more familiar with the
Oswalds than you are, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. She is more familiar with Marina. As far as our meeting like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
Christmas and Easter, I did the talking in a conversation with Oswald, and
Elena and Marina were back in the bedroom talking as women do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During that period of time that you knew Oswald, did you
become aware of the fact that he and Marina were having difficulties with their
marriage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. We heard that she was living with someone else at one time, I
don't know who. My wife can probably tell you. And we also heard that he
beat her up one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever see any indication that he had beaten her up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I didn't; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it your impression that the Oswalds were having marital
difficulties at the time Marina lived in your house or in Mrs. Hall's house in
Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The only reason that Marina lived there at that time was
because Oswald didn't have an apartment in Dallas, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. To give him a chance to get settled; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you help the Oswalds move?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No. My wife moved Marina from their apartment there at Montgomery
Ward to our home in a pickup truck that she borrowed from her employer
at that time. But she didn't move, or neither of us helped him move to
Dallas. We were in New York when they moved to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recall when you went to New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, we got back&mdash;we were married on the 17th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; I believe. We left about 2 weeks earlier than that, which
would be about, say, November the 1st, 2d, or 3d, and I came back and&mdash;a week
later, and went directly to Odessa, finished my business, and moved back to
Fort Worth, met my wife at the plane on the 16th, and we were married on
the 17th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember how long Marina had been living with your
wife before you went to New York? In other words, when did Marina first move
into the house with your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, she would have moved in in the late, the latter part of October,
because since she left during the week that my wife actually came back
from New York&mdash;you see I came back a week earlier than she did, and she
moved out during the last week that my wife was in New York, and that was
the middle of November. It would mean that since she stayed in our home
about 3 weeks, she moved there the latter part of October, and moved out the
middle of November. We don't really know what day, I don't think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Because you weren't there when she moved out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; we were in New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She was gone when you got back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any idea where Oswald was living in Dallas during
the time his wife was living in your house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. We understood&mdash;this is hearsay from George Bouhe, I guess&mdash;that
he was living at the YMCA.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As far as you knew, he moved directly from the YMCA to the
apartments on Elsbeth Street, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. The next time we heard of him, he was living on Elsbeth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know of any other place he might have lived in
Dallas before taking that apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Then he moved around the corner, around the corner from Elsbeth
to an upstairs apartment in a white house, whatever the address on Neely
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. N-e-e-l-y?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I don't really remember the name, but it was upstairs, and it was
Easter, so they had moved between Christmas and Easter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever lend any money to Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether your wife ever lent any money to them
or gave any money to Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I don't know about money. She bought groceries for them, for
Marina, but as far as money, I don't think she ever loaned them any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did your wife buy groceries for Marina only during the time
that Marina lived in your house, is that right? Or did she buy groceries for
the Oswalds at other times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No. I believe they did receive, the women contributed, and George
Bouhe bought some groceries over to their place by Montgomery Ward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Prior to the time that Oswald moved to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Yes; I believe so. I am not sure of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't have any idea how much groceries were given to
the Oswalds during that period of time, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; my wife would probably have a good idea of this in dollars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss with Oswald his military service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I can't remember a thing being said, about his military service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of anything else that you might know about
Oswald that your wife wouldn't be able to testify about, that you think the
Commission should know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No, sir; I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever indicate a desire to go to Cuba or to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Not to me; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear of his indicating such a desire to anybody
else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you surprised when you heard that Oswald had been
arrested in connection with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Not at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You weren't surprised?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, exactly our feelings, Mrs. Clark called my wife and said that
they had arrested Oswald, and we had the television set in our laboratory&mdash;at
that time we were watching television and were on the wrong channel and
didn't get this until 5 or 10 or 15 minutes later. We did get it, and when they
mentioned it was Oswald, they were sure it was Oswald, then all of us&mdash;I am
talking about my wife and Mrs. Clark and Max and ourself, subsequently talking,
we said, "I am not surprised at all. That is the kind of guy that would do
something like that." And this was generally the feeling among all the people
we knew that knew him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any opinion, or was any opinion expressed during
these conversations as to why Oswald would have done this, and if he did it,
what his motive was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Well, we felt like he was not mentally disarranged. I actually
thought Oswald was pretty sharp with his words. I mean the way he talked, he
didn't talk like he was stupid. He was pretty sharp. If he had the right
training in the right direction, he could have done something with his life. But
I always thought he was just completely out in left field in politics, that he didn't
come close to us, so this is actually my feeling, because he was so intent on
his ideas of this book that related to the Marxism theories, he was so intent
and so set&mdash;in other words, when you talked to him about this, you just didn't
have any idea at all that you were going to change him. Even though I was
trying to convince him that our system was a tremendous enterprise, was the
best, when I started talking to him, I didn't feel like I had a chance to change
his thinking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You think that these political attitudes of his were somehow
related to his involvement in the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Say that again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think that these political attitudes or economic attitudes
that Oswald had provided him a motive to want to assassinate the President?
Or were related to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. My&mdash;this is just my personal feeling, but I definitely feel that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
thought that he was going to destroy the middle of our economic way of life
by doing that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You thought it was sort of a technique for him to express his
resentment against the structure of our society that he disproved of? Is that
a fair statement of your thinking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have the feeling that Oswald desired recognition for
his abilities and for his ideas? Recognition from people generally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; I didn't think of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have a feeling, or did you think about this before the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't think he was different from anybody else in that
respect? You just never thought of it, or it never came to your mind prior to
the assassination, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I felt just the opposite on the recognition part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He really didn't care what people thought about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. No; maybe he was saying this wrong to me, what he really believed.
But from my thoughts, I thought that he would be happy if he had this so-called
job like he was talking about in Russia and had complete security. And I
thought this is just what he was looking for in life, was complete serenity and
happiness, no problems, no money problems, no rent problems&mdash;you see what I
mean, just a middle-of-the-roader.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you didn't think he had any desire to stand out or be excellent
at things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. When I said middle-of-the-road, he had these firm ideas which
couldn't be changed, as far as I am concerned, and he would go off in the other
direction. So that doesn't lead him to be a middle-of-the-roader. He is, from
my thinking, a rebellious-type person. He is going to do it the way he thinks
right, and nobody is going to change him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear, or did you ever take part in any discussion
with anyone on the question of whether or not Oswald was possibly an agent
of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. This came up after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There was no discussion about that prior to the assassination,
that you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. As an agent for Russia before, no, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And it never occurred to you at any time prior to the assassination
that Oswald might be a Russian agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. We didn't figure he had sense enough in that respect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you consider the question after the assassination and you
did discuss it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Just enough to think, "Do you think it was possible." In that&mdash;and
my firm thoughts about it is that, of course, that is just my thinking, but
I don't see how there could be any connection. He is not responsible enough to
have authority above him. In other words, he couldn't have anybody above him
really telling him what to do. He couldn't take the orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have a feeling that Oswald was resentful of authority,
generally speaking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I say that, but if he lived in Russia, with their system, he must
have had a lot of authority above him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever indicate to you in any way that he was resentful
of authority?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. I don't know about our system of government in authority. He was
just resentful of, in my thinking, I don't know, well, he was just resentful of our
way of government. I don't know of anything to judge him on, how resentful
he was of his superior officers in the service or anything like that, but he was
resentful of our way of life. Not just our government. He was resentful of
our whole way of life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever tell you specifically, as far as you can remember,
why he was resentful of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Insecurity, I guess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As far as jobs were concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. Basically, that's right; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If you don't have anything else that you want to add at this
point, we shall terminate your deposition. Thank you, Mr. Hall.</p>

<h2 id="t415"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_MRS_FRANK_H_RAY_VALENTINA" id="TESTIMONY_OF_MRS_FRANK_H_RAY_VALENTINA">TESTIMONY OF MRS. FRANK H. RAY (VALENTINA)</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Mrs. Frank H. Ray (Valentina) was taken at 4:10 p.m.,
on March 25, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,
Bryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mrs. Ray, before we start, I will swear you as a witness. If
you will rise and raise your right hand, <span class="locked">please&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Surely. (Complying.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to
give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Please be seated. Before we start I would like to advise you
that my name is Wesley J. Liebeler and I am a member of the legal staff of
the President's Commission investigating the assassination of President Kennedy.
Staff counsel have been authorized to take the testimony of witnesses by
the Commission pursuant to authority granted to the Commission by Executive
Order 11130 dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution of Congress No.
137. I understand Mr. Rankin wrote you a letter last week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. With which he included copies of the Executive <span class="locked">order&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And congressional resolution and also a copy of the rules of
procedure of the Commission concerning the taking of testimony.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You received the letter and copies of the documents?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Our questioning of you today will be concerned basically with
the knowledge of the Oswalds which you might have gained as a result of your
association with them in 1962. Before I get into that, I would like to have you
state your full name for the record, if you would.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Mrs. Frank H. Ray.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I live 4524 Alta Vista, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where were you born, Mrs. Ray?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. In Stalino, Ukraine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is in the Ukraine; it is the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When were you born?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. June 9, 1927.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did it come about that you came to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. When I was 14 years old Germans occupy my part of Ukraine and
they take me to Germany as slave labor. I work for Germans from 1942 until
1945, then Americans occupy part of Germany where I live.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What part of Germany?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Dusseldorf on Rhine; in March of 1945, Americans occupy that part
of Germany and I went to work for Americans and then I married an American
and came over here. This was in 1946, July 18.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Henry W. Bahlkow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He was a member of the U.S. Army?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes, 36th Division and he was&mdash;I don't know what outfit at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
time but I know it was field artillery. I can give you present address if that
help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is he living in St. Louis?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No, Hicksville, Long Island?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is his address?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I forget number&mdash;Evelyn Street. Evelyn Street&mdash;it would be easy
to look it up and he works for Sperry Gyroscope. He is an electrical engineer
over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were taken from Russia at the age of 14?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you work for the Germans after that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I imagine that kind of interfered with your formal education?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Let's say it stopped it completely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What formal educational background do you have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I finished seventh grade over there in Russia but I think&mdash;I don't
know whether it is a little bit more or not. I had already gotten into algebra,
geometry, and physics and I don't know how you compare schools here to school
over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any formal education other than that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. When I came over here I went to International Institute in St. Louis
for about 2 years to learn to speak English and then I went to Roosevelt High
School, St. Louis, finished school and Washington University 2 years to study
American history and English for my citizen papers and I became citizen 1949.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you move to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I moved in Dallas June of 1954. See, I married in June of 1954;
I remarried.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What does your present husband do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. He is in advertising; it is specialty advertising by the name of
Pollock and Ray.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is located in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. 3508 Dickason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did there come a time you met Lee Harvey and Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; I am not sure about the month. I mean closest I could come
to it, I imagine, would be early November 1962. She had been staying at Mrs.
Ford's house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Marina had?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; and Mrs. Ford called me up and said would I please see if I
could keep her at my house a little while since she was going to have company.
I said certainly she was welcome. She was alone with baby at the time and she
came to my house on a Saturday. I am not sure about the date; all I know is
the day; spent 1 day with me and since I have no baby bed she went back to
Mrs. Ford's house. Sunday I moved her completely over to my house with baby
clothes and crib and that Sunday afternoon, Lee called about 4 in the afternoon
and he asked me if he could come see his baby and wife and I said certainly he
can come out. He asked me "How I could get." I told him what bus to take and
my husband picked him up at corner filling station on Preston and Forest.</p>

<p>He came out and they went in bedroom to talk. At the time they had some
kind of separation, I understand, and they talked for about an hour in the room
by themselves and by that time it was getting to be suppertime so I invited them
to stay and have something to eat with us. He ate and she decided to go back
with him. He told her he rented an apartment so my husband packed everything
back up in the car and took them to an apartment, I believe, at Elsbeth Street at
the time and then I didn't see him for about 3 or 4 months. Then I didn't see
him for about 3 or 4 months, maybe 2 months. I had gathered a lot of baby
clothes from my neighbors and friends and took them down to Elsbeth Street and
stayed about a half hour, had a cup of coffee and I left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was Lee there then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; he was there at that time and I felt uncomfortable because
the more I talked the quieter he got and I felt a little out of place and in a half
hour I picked up and left. I brought all these clothes for the baby. They didn't
have anything in the house. He didn't seem to be ungrateful but looked like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
"We don't need it." He didn't say it but that look was on his face. Marina
thanked me for the clothes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Lee did not thank you for the clothes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Didn't say a word. I hardly exchanged two words with him. I
talked with him that the baby was beautiful, small talk is all it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Going back to the time that Lee came out to your house and
talked with his <span class="locked">wife&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You said Lee had told Marina he rented an apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have an impression they did not have an apartment
prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I got impression that they did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember how you got that impression?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Because I asked Marina, you know, where he going to take her.
He said he had rented apartment. I said "What kind of apartment?" She
didn't say. She sounded to me like she didn't know what apartment was going
to be. She had never lived in that apartment. Later on when I talked to her
on everything she described apartment&mdash;"I have living room, bedroom, kitchen,
and bathroom"&mdash;so I am almost certain that is the impression I am stuck with.
I didn't know she had apartment. He just rented to get them back. I have no
idea how long she had been with her friends after that day they fight. I know
she was at Anna Meller's and then Mrs. Ford's and then my house and prior to
that I had no idea where she has been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to Mrs. Ford about the reasons for the Oswalds
marital difficulties?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I asked her what was matter and she said he was mean to her;
he beat her up and she left him because of that. I felt terrible sorry for her
because Mrs. Ford described to me she could not speak English and didn't know
anybody there. That's the only reason given to me that he struck her or beat
her up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mrs. Ford didn't go into any greater detail as to what reason for
beating her up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No, no; when Marina came to my house I hated to butt in since she
was only with me 1 day and 2 days and didn't spend night. I don't like to
question somebody right away what is trouble, why did you leave&mdash;I am not that
nosey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was the first time you met Marina when you went to Mrs.
Ford's to pick her up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Had you heard about her prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes, about a year before from Mrs. Ford. She said there is a
new girl lives in Fort Worth; she just got here from Russia and, see, I am
not sure about that time, year, 6 months, and I said "I would very much like to
meet her to see how things are in Russia since it has been almost 20 years since
I left Russia" at that time. Of course, I was very curious to find out if conditions
had changed and what is going on now. I think it is no more than normal
curiosity on my part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any conversations with Anna Meller about why
Marina came to stay with her or what the circumstances were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. None with Anna Meller, not about Marina's circumstances at all.
I came to Mrs. Meller one time to pick up few things that Marina left over
there and that was the same time when I went over to take the clothes to
Marina's house. I picked up a few things at Anna Meller's house but she had
company at the time so we didn't have a chance to talk. I just said hello, picked
up the things and went to Oswald's place on Elsbeth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At the first time that you met Oswald himself was on the day
that he came out to your house to talk to <span class="locked">Marina&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; at my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you recall and tell us to the best of your recollection what
Oswald said at that time and what the conversation was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. My talk with him mostly just on&mdash;what did I talk to him about?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
I am trying to remember. It really wasn't anything. We just sort of talked
about the children, small talk as I remember but he did get into a conversation
with my husband which was more on economics. He could not understand how
he have to work for somebody and man made all the money and gave so little
in return. Anyhow it was something about workers and capitalists. As I can
imagine my husband said some things because, well, he worked hard all his life
and had men work for him. That was said at the house, then they had another
conversation in the car when he took to apartment. I was not present so I do
not know what they talking about. It was still on economics and my husband
just came in huffing, puffing, said he never met anybody dumber in his life,
doesn't understand simple economics or how anything works in this country.
He considered him a complete idiot. He didn't know how in the world I got tied
up with stupid people like that but I had very little to say to Lee Oswald that
evening he was at the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you spoke to Marina did you speak to her in Russian or
in English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. In Russian at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know whether Marina could understand English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. At the time she could not understand but maybe few words
like simple words like if I say bread or&mdash;I would say she did not understand
maybe more than 2 dozen words and that would be simple things you use
every day in the kitchen, not any English at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss with Oswald the question of why he did not
try to teach Marina English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; but who did I ask about that? I believe I asked Marina why
she didn't speak English with Oswald all the time. No; I did ask Oswald that,
I'm sorry, but that was not that evening. I asked him that when I went to
Elsbeth Street; I asked how come he didn't speak English to her so she would
learn. He said so he wouldn't forget his Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you say in response to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I said after she learns English they could speak Russian all time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald make any response to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. None whatsoever. It was very hard to talk to him. He was
absolutely&mdash;you could ask him question, if you lucky, you might get answer.
He did not say one word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether Oswald drank at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. When he came over my husband and I sit down and had a drink.
I asked him if he would like to have something. He said "Thank you, I don't
drink," so I don't know whether it was just that day or period but from the way
he said it, I got the impression he did not drink because he would have said
I don't care for any today or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember anything more about the conversation that
occurred that first Sunday when Oswald came over?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; I don't think so; all was small talk. We talked about my cat,
how children behaved, things that had no meaning, just to keeping the conversation
going and he was so hard to talk to, why, I could not find anything he
was interested in and I did not know him well enough to discuss anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina tell you anything about her background in Russia,
where she was born, where she was raised?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Sir, I don't know who told me that; it is so hard to remember where
I got the information from. I understand that she was raised by her mother
until mother die and she lived either with grandmother or aunt, I am not sure.
I think it is an aunt she said that raised her and the first time&mdash;like I said,
information was from everybody; it gets to so and so and by that time, it got
to me&mdash;first I heard about was she was only child and later on I found out
she has sister and brother in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She told you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; she did; she has sister in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did Marina tell you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. This was about 2 weeks ago when I visited her but from what I
understood before, she was only child. After her mother died she lived with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
her aunt. Now, I don't know if Marina told me that or I got that information
from Mrs. Ford or some of the other people that I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you say you are a friend of Mrs. Ford's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I have known Mrs. Ford for a long time. I would say yes. I
mean she is not my very closest friend but she is a friend; yes. I see her now
and then three or four times a year maybe sometimes more. She is the first
Russian I met here in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you at the Ford's party between Christmas and New
Year's, 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember seeing Oswald there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; I do. I got there early because I had to bring some hor
d'oeuvres for the party and they walked in and I was very much surprised to
see them. I just said "Hello, how's the baby?" She said "Fine" and then I
went and started immediately with the other people. He is so hard to talk to
and this was a party and I did not want to spend my time drawing it out of
him and thought I would go where there is better conversation going on and
I did and in about an hour or so, it seems like they were gone. I just spoke
that one time "Hello, how is the baby" and made few comments. They did
not stay very long and I think that is the first time she ever left baby with baby
sitter; somebody was talking care.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know how Oswald came to the party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; later on <span class="locked">"Katya"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is K-a-t-y-a [spelling]?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Katya told me&mdash;that is Mrs. Ford&mdash;George De Mohren&mdash;it's
something; I don't know him very well at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; they brought them to the party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you hear any conversation about the Oswalds after the
Oswalds left the part?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you present at any discussions over this weekend or during
the period following the Ford party in which the question of whether or not
Oswald was an agent of the Soviet Union was discussed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; in fact, I have not seen anybody after the party for&mdash;normally,
I don't see any of the Russians that were at the time of the party. We usually
see each other maybe once, twice year; one time at "Katya's" house and maybe
I give one, so I did not see anyone since that party except Mrs. Ford and we
did not discuss anything about Oswald at all. I might have mentioned what is
he doing, where he's work and she did not say. I really have no information
after that party. I did not discuss them with anybody that I can remember
and I know I never discussed about him being an agent, and neither have I
heard it from anybody. Nobody said to me or implied he was connected in any
way, you know, with Russia in any way at all. Nobody ever mention it to me
and I have never discussed it with anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever indicate to you that he wanted to go back to
Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear that he wanted to go back to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Not until after this all came out in the papers after the
assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever have any political discussions with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Not&mdash;I do not know enough because&mdash;I do not know anything about
politics. Let us say I could not discuss it intelligently, therefore, I usually stay
away from that subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form an opinion of Marina Oswald prior to the assassination
based on your exposure to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; I felt terribly sorry for her. I felt that Lee probably would
never make her any kind of a living the way he was, just made so little money
and did not want her to have any friends, did not want her to learn how to speak
English, objected to her wearing makeup; anything she did he objected to,
almost everything, and I felt sorry for her because I felt she would be a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
lonely girl living in this country and I liked her very much and wanted to help
any way I could, and I <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think Marina was a particularly intelligent person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. At first I did not because I knew her so short&mdash;I mean it was a
short time. At the time I thought she was just quiet and a very nice little girl
and I thought she was smart but I did not think she was extremely intelligent,
but since that time I think she is quite intelligent girl. I think she knows what
she is doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think she was immature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, immature&mdash;I did at first, I thought she was little immature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. A little immature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; then I forget just how young she is. I was probably just as
immature as she is right now. It is quite a changeover come over to another
country. In your own country might not be considered immature but over here
without speaking English and not knowing a lot of things, people might consider
you immature where you really not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many times have you seen Marina since the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. First time she came over my house I kept baby at my house when
she had to go down for questioning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember when this was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. In February, I am not sure about dates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that before she went to Washington?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; she was already staying at Mrs. Ford's house. This was after
she moved in with Mrs. Ford. She brought little baby over and I took care of
youngest one, Rachel, and I went over there about 5 days later and babysat for
all children, Mrs. Ford's child and they all have to go down to see lawyer; I
believe Mr. McKenzie at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you ever met Mr. McKenzie?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No. Then I went to see Marina's house after she rented one in
Richardson, then I went over to take her shopping and then went over and took
Mr. George Bouhe with me one day. Then I went over one more time and that
was last time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to Marina at all about the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. You know, I felt very uncomfortable asking all those questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did speak to her about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I did ask her and I said "Do you really think he did it?" And
she says "Well, I think so" and I said "Well, do the children miss him?" She
said "No, she doesn't even&mdash;June doesn't even remember him." And then I asked
if she was lonely. She said "Of course, I am" and that is about the only thing.
I talked about mostly her personal things not about the assassination because,
I don't know, it just seems I hated to bring up the subject. I think it is a tragic
thing. I thought if she wanted to volunteer something, of course, I would be
happy to talk to her about it but she did not and I really did not ask.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you why she thought Oswald did it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; we did not go into that so much. I just ask her if she thought
he did it and she said "Yes, I think he did do it."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ask her how she had been treated by the Secret Service
and FBI?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. She said wonderful and everyone perfect and I say same, everyone
came to my house, they were very nice people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you read in the papers since the assassination a story to
the effect that Oswald wanted to make an attempt on the life of Richard Nixon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. In the papers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Richard Nixon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss that with Marina at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I did not even know about that. That is one I missed on Richard
Nixon. I did not know it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The story was not that he had actually done so, that he wanted
to do so and got into a discussion with Marina about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. That is the first I heard about it that you mention it. I am sorry,
I must have missed the story and I usually read the paper but I missed that one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you talked to Mrs. Ford about her conversations with
Marina and her relations with Marina since the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; mostly I talked to Mrs. Ford about what she is going to do
and she told me about renting house and later on she plans to go to school learn
English and then she wants to go through pharmacists school. I think she
wants to be a pharmacist. Again, I mostly talked about her future more than
anything else with Mrs. Ford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear anything to the effect that Lee Oswald had
tried to commit suicide while he was in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I don't know; did I read that in the paper or what? But I remember
vaguely that he tried to commit suicide but I don't know how or when. I
vaguely remember reading about that. I think it was in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't think you learned that from Marina or someone else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear anything about Marina wanting to commit
suicide or attempt to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you spoke to Oswald did you speak to him in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; I spoke to him in English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear him speak Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; he speak to Marina and baby always.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form an opinion as to his ability to speak Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. He spoke fairly good Russian. He had the accent, the ending, every
time you change a sentence you change the ending and his were not quite as
Russian would be. It was Russian definitely spoken by foreigner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think he spoke Russian well?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; because I could understand everything he said and I think&mdash;I
don't know, I think he spoke Russian as well as I speak English but it was
quite well; Russian to me is harder to learn than English would be and it would
take longer than 2, 3 years living in Russia to learn perfect it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think he spoke Russian with an ability of about what
you would expect after living in Russia for 3 years or do you think he spoke
Russian as well as that or better than that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. His pronunciation was very, very good. His only mistakes were
mostly on endings of words, you know, as I recollect, but I don't know. I think
he spoke maybe little bit better than average person would speak.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After 3 years or so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It did not strike you as being extraordinarily better?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did not think he had any special training in the Russian
language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; I did not think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss this question with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina ever tell you anything about living in Leningrad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; because&mdash;I don't know whether Marina told me or Mrs.
Ford when I first heard. She told me there's girl came from Leningrad, you
know, that is from one person to another, from Minsk to Leningrad; when I
first heard about Marina they said she came over here from Leningrad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't recall anything about hearing anything about Marina
moving from Leningrad to Minsk, do you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know, of course, why Marina moved from Leningrad
to Minsk, if she did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina ever tell you anything about how she met Oswald
in Russia and why she married him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I do not know how she met him but she said she fell in love and
married him but this we talked last few weeks, I talked to her about that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us how that conversation came up and what was
said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I think she asked me how I came over and I told her. I asked
her how did she. I don't think I asked how she met Lee; I just&mdash;what did she
tell me? Isn't it funny, I don't remember. She might have said something.
I don't remember if she did or not. I think I did ask how they met and I
cannot quite place where they did meet. Isn't that funny? This is just few
weeks ago&mdash;me and my brain, but I know they said they went together little
while and she fell in love with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Could you tell us what your first name is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. My first name is Valentina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never got the impression that Marina married Oswald just
to get out of Russia, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, she never said in so many words but I imagine that had a
lot to do with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What do you mean when you say you "imagine"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. If you ever lived in Russia, believe you me, you grab first chance
get out of there if you halfway smart. After Americans came into Germany
I had chance to go back to Russia. I chose to stay in Germany. I was so
young when I left but I still know that life in Germany was far superior to
Russian. I decided of my own free will not to go back to Russia. I could have
very easily but did not want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, your thought that Marina might have had that in her
mind when she married Oswald is based on your own experience?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; in Russia, girl would be more than glad marry an American
and come over here. Yes; I base it strictly on my own experience.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form an opinion of Oswald himself as a result of
your acquaintance?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; I thought he was rather arrogant and I did not think he
was even&mdash;I did not think him too intelligent and terribly unfriendly and very
much of a loner. He did not seem to care for anybody. He did not talk to
anybody. You get the impression he does not like you even though you did
not do anything or speak two words to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you surprised when you heard he had been arrested
in connection with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. When I saw it on television, I almost fainted. I could not believe
it. It was terrible surprise. My reaction is "My God, it's Lee Oswald" when
I saw his picture. First I heard name; they said they suspected Lee Oswald
and for moment, I could not connect name but I know I heard it some place and
when I saw his picture, that is first I knew he was back in Dallas. I knew
they moved to New Orleans. I had not heard they were back in Dallas. Of
course, I immediately called Mrs. Ford and talked to her about that. I said,
"Do you know it's Lee Oswald?" She said, "Yes; I know." I was terribly, terribly
surprised it was him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Mrs. Ford seem to be surprised?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. She was just as shocked as I was. I must say when I knew Lee
he did not strike me as assassination type but then I knew him so shortly. It
is not if I knew him for long time. I had no way form any kind of opinion
what kind of person he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But he never struck you at that time as being dangerous or
prone to violence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I thought he was just capable of striking his wife because he was
striking his wife. I think I resented him from the first time when I heard he
struck his wife. I resent any man, of course. I probably met him not liking
him to start out with for that simple reason that he struck Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you or your husband ever give any money to the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You said you gave some baby clothes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Baby clothes, yes; they were used baby clothes I just gathered
from my friends and whatever I had left. See, I had small children, too.
I have three, 8, 6, and 4 and at that time my 2-year-old, little boy, she could
wear all underthings. She could wear corduroy pants and stuff like that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever learn of anyone else giving the Oswalds any money
or groceries or clothes or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; I think everybody tried to help her with clothes, mostly. I gave
her some of my clothes and I knew we all had given them things but I don't
know of anyone gave them money and I believe Mr. George Bouhe tried to help
him find job; I knew that much and I don't know if they succeeded. I think
last job, I think he had with some printing company, I believe Mr. Bouhe found
for him. He was making $1.35 an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina have any money or did you ever see her spend any
money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; I never was around her much that she ever went to store.
She never had any clothes hardly for herself except what was given by us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know what Lee and Marina Oswald talked about that
night Lee came over to your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; I sent them in bedroom and they talking. I think mostly
it was he begged her to come back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But Marina never told you what they talked about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; she said he practically went on knees and begged her to come
back; he was very&mdash;and she left. She mostly mention he cried and begged her
and said "I think I go back." I said, "After all, he is your husband," I said,
you know, "better, of course, you go back."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you had any discussions with any of your friends or have
you given any thought since, yourself, since the assassination as to what might
have motivated Oswald to do this, assuming he is the one who killed the
President?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Of course, we discussed the assassination but we mostly say did
you ever think he would do it, and, say for instance, I would say to Mrs. Ford;
she said "No; I never dreamed he would do it." Then we would discuss lot
of people say he was maybe connected with someone else but to my knowledge
everybody I asked, nobody thinks he was connected with anyone, but done
it on his own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss why he might have done it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; because I don't know and I don't think anybody really knows
what prompted him to do such a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you discussed with your friends and thought about any
possible connection between Oswald and Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Quite a few friends called me and asked me if I knew anything
about it and I said no, that I had no idea he would be connected with Ruby.
He was not the kind of man to go into night clubs or any place like that; therefore,
when I read article in paper where he had been in Carousel Club, I was
very much surprise because did not seem like Lee Oswald. He was not a nightclub,
girlie-show-type, not to me at all and I talked to Marina in last few weeks
and she said he never wanted to go to nightclub. He despised them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Has Marina ever indicated to you since the assassination or
even before the assassination what kind of husband Oswald was to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. We talked little bit about that since&mdash;I mean this last few weeks,
February or even first of March, I asked her, she said he was very kind to her.
He would tell her more things than he would anybody else. He could completely
confide in her at times, even cry sometime when he talk to her, when
he talked to her about his feelings and ambitions and he was just absolutely
crazy about his children. He was positively and he was so possessive about
the children even in my presence, it was uncomfortable. He would feed that
little girl until she couldn't open her mouth. He said, "Let me see your teeth"
and he would stick another spoonful until the child would throw up and until
now she's rotten spoiled and Marina said it is because of him. He worshiped
her, I should say. He did absolutely everything for that child and he did hit
her sometimes and then he would cry, "Why did I do it; what possessed me
to do it" but, I said, "Do you think he loved you?" She said, "Yes, I am certain
he did love me" and this is after this all happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina ever say anything to you about Oswald's attitude
toward sex or their own sexual relations?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. She never said and I have never asked her but I think I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
hear from Mrs. Ford he was rather cold man; that is remark she made to me
and that is only thing I knew about it. We did not go into it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never discussed it with Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; I don't know; that is private subject. I would not discuss it
with her. She never volunteer and I never did ask.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear any stories or rumors prior to the assassination
or at anytime, for that matter, to the effect that Marina was remotely
involved or interested in any of the people in the Russian group or colony or
anybody prior to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any reason to believe yourself that anything like
that may have been the case?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; no reason at all. I do not know who it could be; most are
older people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There was nothing that you ever heard or had any reason to
suspect about Oswald being abnormal, homosexual in anyway?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No, I did not know anything about it, nor did I suspect anything
about that. I read someplace in newspaper something, trying to tie him in
with something homosexual but I did not hear it from anybody at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you did not suspect it yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No, no; I certainly did not. At least I did not think he looked
like one; then I don't know what one looks like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever have any information or knowledge to the
effect that Oswald owned a rifle prior to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; in fact, I am surprised how in the world he could have bought
it with as little money as he was making; how can you afford to buy a rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't think I have any more questions at this point. I want
you to feel free to add anything that you think the Commission might want
to know about or should know about.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I know I forgot something when she was at my house. Mr.
George Bouhe and I took her out to lunch. Actually, George Bouhe took us
out, her and me, to lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; this was when she was staying at my house in 1962. We were
trying discuss what we were going to do with her because she had left her
husband, with one child, could not speak English and both knew she could
not go from one friend to another. First thing she had to do was speak little
bit of English and I volunteered she could stay at my house as long as it is
necessary and I will be talking to her in English very slowly and teach her as
much as I could at the time and put her in night school where she could learn
little bit more. Actually, it was just luncheon to decide what, not immediately,
we are going to do for her later on, so as it turned out to be, Lee Oswald came
and got her before we did anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was Marina there at the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; she went to lunch with me and George Bouhe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Bouhe finally gave up trying to help Marina and Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. He was so disgusted when she went back with Lee. He would
have done anything for her. He said "If she goes back, I wash my hands clean";
from then on, I don't know if he helped her or not. I know when I took him
out there 2 weeks ago, he said "There's a woman living alone and here I am
calling on her." I said "I will go with you, that will help you if you afraid."
We went to store; she needed baby food; it amounted to $7, groceries, baby
food.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When was this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. About 2 weeks ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Bouhe paid for the groceries?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes, he said "I am 60 years old" he said, "I got diabetes. I have
enough money to live for 30 years. I know I won't be living here 30 years."
She said "I have money." He said "I know but I have money, too." He is very
generous whenever he hears someone comes to this country he is first one to
help them. He helped Anna Meller go to school and Lydia Dymitruk; try to
send her to school but he got tired of dragging her by the ear. She did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
want to go so he gave up on her but he has always been very, very helpful
with people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever get the feeling Oswald was resentful&mdash;thought
Bouhe and these other friends of Bouhe were trying to interfere with his
marriage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I do not know whether he was resentful about that. I do not
think he liked it too well but what would we do? See another Russian thrown
out in the street. We had to help her; it was not interference with the marriage.
It was necessity of keeping roof over her head and food for her baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My question was did you ever have any feeling that Oswald
resented the help; do you think it was just because he was resentful of taking
things from people or do you think these people were trying to interfere with
his marriage is what made him resentful?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I think he resented taking things from people because when she
went back with him he was very unfriendly when I brought clothes to the house.
I think he resented more people just gave them anything. He resented any
kind of help, I think. I got the impression he was a bitter man because, I
imagine when he defected to Russia, it was comedown. He expected them to
give presidency job; he was American and should have a job like that and I
think his hopes went down drain. He seemed like bitter man to me. He
thought he wasn't getting his full share of things he should be getting and I
do not know what that could be and I really did not know him well enough to
add anything else to it because I spent, all in all, I don't think I spent an hour
actually talking to him alone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If you cannot think of anything else that you think you would
like to tell us, I have no further questions.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of anything else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; I cannot think of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I want to thank you very much for coming down.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. You are certainly welcome.</p>

<p>The testimony of Mrs. Igor Vladimir Voshinin was taken at 11:35 a.m., on
March 26, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan
and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Albert E. Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of
the President's Commission. Robert T. Davis, assistant attorney general of
Texas, was present.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Voshinin, will you stand and be sworn, please?</p>

<p>Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth in
this deposition which we are about to take?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I do.</p>

<p>I want to add only that I will&mdash;some of my statements or even the majority
of it, will be to the best of my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; we don't expect you to say any more than that. And, as
a matter of fact, we would appreciate it that you would indicate as you testify
that which you know of your own knowledge and that which came to you by
rumor or that which came to you by way of statement made to you by somebody
else as to what somebody else had said or done&mdash;which we call hearsay.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. All right. And something else&mdash;some of the statements, they
might have been made such a long time ago that they won't be entirely correct.
The sense will be correct, but not the exact words. You realize that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I do&mdash;but you're going to give us the best recollection you have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We don't expect any more.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We don't want any speculation on your <span class="locked">part&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I see. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Other than when we might ask you as to what your impression
or impressions are and what they might not be.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes, sir; I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are Mrs. Igor Voshinin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was your maiden name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 3504 Mockingbird. And you are the wife of Igor Voshinin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Voshinin, did you receive from J. Lee Rankin, the general
counsel of the Commission appointed to investigate the assassination of President
Kennedy, a letter asking if you would <span class="locked">appear&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in which was enclosed the Senate Joint Resolution which
authorized the creation of the Presidential Assassination <span class="locked">Commission&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That Resolution being No. 137; and also the President's, the
Hon. Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order creating the Commission and fixing
its rules and affording it its powers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Together, also, with a third document which is the rules of
procedure of the Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Voshinin, you understand, then, from these documents that
this is a Presidential Commission created in the manner I've indicated and
that we are inquiring into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and
all the circumstances surrounding it and seeking from you and others any
information you have with regard to Marina and Lee Oswald, as well as other
persons who might have or did come in contact with them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Right. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And we understand that you have some information in those
areas and I would like to inquire of you about them.</p>

<p>I am Albert E. Jenner, Jr., a member of the legal staff of the Commission,
and Mr. Robert Davis, to whom I introduced you, is a representative of the
attorney general of the State of Texas. Are you a citizen of the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Naturalized; 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1955; March 7?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were naturalized in New York City, I believe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In New Jersey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In New Jersey. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I was born in Russia in Labinsk. Well, I will spell you
both names, because when I was born it was called Labinskaja&mdash;[spelling]
L-a-b-i-n-s-k-a-j-a; and now, recently, it has been called Labinsk&mdash;just abbreviate
where the "k" is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And orient me&mdash;where is that in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's in Kuban Region. This is the Fore-Caucasus. This
is Southern Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It's in the Caucasus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; they are called Fore-Caucasus&mdash;[spelling] F-o-r-e&mdash;Caucasus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are a person of higher education, are you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, I hold a degree in geology. That's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you've had an education beyond what we, here in America,
call the equivalent of high school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you attend a university?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I attended first University in Yugoslavia for 4 years. It
was philosophy and I did not graduate due to war. Then, I got my bachelor's
degree in geology in Brooklyn College in 1953.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's Brooklyn, N.Y.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Brooklyn, N.Y. And master's degree at Rutgers in 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Rutgers University?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Rutgers University&mdash;right; in geology.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where in Yugoslavia was the university that you attended?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Belgrade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, in short compass, as I understand from your husband who
just deposed, you left Russia or were taken by your parents from Russia when
you were 1 year old?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Something like that; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in what country were you when you first became conscious
of your whereabouts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I was in Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In what town?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Panchevo, next to Belgrade&mdash;[spelling] P-a-n-c-h-e-v-o. And
before that my parents lived for a few years&mdash;I think for a couple of years in
Bulgaria&mdash;in Varna Pleven&mdash;[spelling] V-a-r-n-a P-l-e-v-e-n&mdash;and in Sofia. But
I'm not aware of dates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's just by reputation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If you'll pardon my inquiry, what is your age?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Forty-five; March 21, 1918.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Where did you meet Mr. Voshinin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In Belgrade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. First, I met him when I was about 12 years old and then
I didn't see him for a while; and then, I believe it was in 1939, that I met him
again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In Panchevo. He was working there as a civil engineer&mdash;as
a city engineer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. I understand he's some 12 years older than you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's right. Eleven and a half&mdash;something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he was a civil engineer <span class="locked">in&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In the city of Panchevo.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In 1942?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1939?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, 1939; yes. And through 1942, I would say. Because
he was in the Army during the war, you know, in the <span class="locked">beginning&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. He was drafted to the Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What Army?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yugoslavian Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were conscious of that fact, were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I don't&mdash;what do you mean, "conscious"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you were aware of the fact he had been drafted and was
in the Yugoslavian Army?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, yes; that was after we were married. We married in
1940&mdash;January 21.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. January 21, 1940?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And after your <span class="locked">marriage&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. After our marriage, he was drafted, first, to the exercises&mdash;you
know, the Army training.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I believe it was in 1941. You know, the war already started&mdash;remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In 1939.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. The war started in September of 1939.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. 1939; yes; something like that. And then just after the
Germans attacked Yugoslavia, my husband was called&mdash;got a telegram to appear.
And then he returned back in 19&mdash;let's see, when was that? 1942&mdash;no;
in 1941, I believe. Yes; 1941. I think that the Germans attacked us in April
1941&mdash;Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Invaded Yugoslavia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Invaded Yugoslavia; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you there then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, yes; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you moved from Yugoslavia to where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. To Germany. First, they took my husband and they sent an
invitation to me, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To come to Germany?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. To come to Germany. No; don't say "invitation", I'm sorry.
This is just a joke. It was&mdash;well, they would just ask you to appear and when
you appeared they would give you a questionnaire to fill in. After that you
were deported&mdash;you are supposed to go here and there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were directed to go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. To Germany&mdash;drafted with other young people. At that
time they were doing that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were drafted into the work labor force?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Into the work labor force; right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you went, then, to Germany?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. To Austria; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Austria?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. To Austria&mdash;Linz Am Donau&mdash;[spelling] L-i-n-z A-m
D-o-n-a-u. This means Linz on the Danube&mdash;because there was another Linz
there in Austria.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were there in Austria until when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Until, I believe, March 1945&mdash;until the Russian troops started
approaching Linz Am Donau&mdash;because already they were on the outskirts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Already they were on the outskirts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. They were already approaching. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You could hear the guns?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; I didn't hear them very well&mdash;but Igor was at that time
at the outskirts of the city and he heard them quite distinctly&mdash;the city of
Linz. And then we just didn't lose any time leaving Linz. And we took a
westerly direction&mdash;we didn't care which.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You wanted any direction away from <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Exactly opposite direction away from Russians. Let's put
it this way. And that was our direction throughout our life, I'm afraid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your direction all your life has been away from the Russians?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; away from the Russians.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you went to where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, we came as far as Kempten, Bavaria. And, of course,
we were stopped there because we heard that that's as far as you can go without
being extensively controlled by Germans. Because, you see, we did not have
the permit to leave, or anything. We did not have any permit to leave town&mdash;and
this we might have been shot for it. Because, before we left town&mdash;several
days before&mdash;Germans made an announcement that whoever leaves will
be put to death. But, if we stayed, we would be put to death by Russians&mdash;so,
what could we lose, you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you arrived in Bavaria&mdash;and were you liberated by anybody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's right&mdash;by lots of people. First, I believe it was French
Moroccan troops, they were the first who just zoomed through Kempten; and
then came American troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were completely liberated by them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; that's right. It was good!</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were pleased to see the Americans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. You bet! I was pleased to see the Moroccans also, you
know&mdash;any friend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you come to America then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And settled temporarily, at least initially, in New Jersey?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In New York&mdash;well, let's see. No. First of all we settled
in New York. We were taken to the Diplomat Hotel and put down there. Then
we lived at the Diplomat Hotel for&mdash;I'm not sure&mdash;Gee, I don't remember. Anyway,
we worked in New York always, both of us, my husband and I, and we
lived in Bayonne, N.J., part of the time in New York, and then we lived in
Highland Park, N.J.&mdash;which was across the bridge from New Brunswick. New
Brunswick is were Rutgers University is. I was going there, so we lived across
the bridge from it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you eventually come to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. It was in September&mdash;beginning of September 1955. I believe
it was around the 1st or 6th of September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you come to Dallas directly, or did you stop in another
Texas city first?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, we went on vacation before we directly settled in Dallas
and we were sort of looking around where would be right to stop. So, we went
to Houston but the climate was not quite pleasant there&mdash;and, you know, my
husband had a very bad case of asthma in New York and he was advised to look
for a hot and dry climate. So, we decided against that. And then we came to
Dallas and liked it very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you like the climate here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Very much. Yes, indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your husband was very helpful in telling us about the Russian
community that you found here, or the community in which you moved, which
he related largely to two parishes of the Greek Orthodox Church. He said that
when you and he came to Dallas, either you didn't know anybody at all, or you
knew some one person&mdash;I forget.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; we didn't know anybody at all personally. But, you see,
when we were in Houston, we met there&mdash;of course, we went to the church first.
That's usually your first move. And we met the priest there <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Father Alexander Chernay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Spell it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. [Spelling] C-h-e-r-n-a-y&mdash;or "I". I don't know how he spelled
it.</p>

<p>And then he introduced us to Mrs. Jitkoff's mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Spell that, too.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Let me think of her name. What was her name? She died.
She was the mother of Mrs. Andre Jitkoff&mdash;[spelling] J-i-t-k-o-f-f. 3714 Locke
Lane&mdash;if you need the address.</p>

<p>And, first of all, we met her and she told us the lay of the land and all the
pros and cons of Texas life. And, finally&mdash;she spoke very convincingly&mdash;she liked
Texas very much&mdash;and we decided to stay here. And she directed us to Mr.
George Bouhe in Dallas. And then we came and met George.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't know Bouhe prior to this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No, sir; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is George Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, he's an accountant, I believe, and I don't know exactly
for whom he worked at that time&mdash;but I know that he worked for a long time
for DeGolyer and MacNaughton. And he was sort of a manager of the Russian
parish there&mdash;Father Alexander's parish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What parish is that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That was the St. Nicholas parish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us about this community of people.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, there were very few people and who we met there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
were Clarks&mdash;one of the first&mdash;Gali and Max Clark&mdash;that's [spelling] G-a-l-i.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In what town do they live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. They live at 3712 Selkirk&mdash;[spelling] S-e-l-k-i-r-k&mdash;in Fort
Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Max Clark is an attorney, is he not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's right; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Mrs. Clark <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. She has also an education in the law.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. An education in law?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; from Europe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is she a naturalized citizen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I believe so, I don't know. She is married to Max&mdash;uh&mdash;she
probably&mdash;that's the way she got to this country. She's not a born American.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What I was getting at is what is her nativity? Do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, she said that her mother is of British descent&mdash;Hughes.
And her father was Russian&mdash;Shcherbatov. It's a very well-known
historical name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Spell that, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. [Spelling] S-h-c-h-e-r-b-a-t-o-v.
Then we met a family by name Popoff&mdash;[spelling] P-o-p-o-f-f&mdash;Nicholas Popoff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does he live here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. He lives here; yes. He's a mechanical engineer. I'm not
sure where he works.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he a native of Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; I think so.</p>

<p>And I believe that's&mdash;yes, there were some people of Ukrainian background.
I don't remember their names, though.</p>

<p>But, anyway, it was a very small parish. And there were also two priests&mdash;young
priests&mdash;one monk, Father Hilary Madison, and another one, Father
Dimitri Royster.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's [spelling] R-o-y-s-t-e-r?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Right. And that is where our troubles with George Bouhe
started.</p>

<p>I mean, George Bouhe wanted to make it a Russian-speaking parish. And
Father Royster and Father Hilary were believing that it would be much better
if it were an English-speaking parish because it would be a church of the future.</p>

<p>And, of course, I know, according to my brother's children, that they always
tend to go to English-speaking services, because they say that they understand
much better English. They do not understand Church Slavonic at all. You
know, that's an obsolete language, slightly different from Russian and different
from modern Russian language.</p>

<p>So, of course, we agreed with those two young priests more than with George.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And here the trouble started.</p>

<p>And we separated finally and Father Dimitri decided to start a new church&mdash;practically
from scratch. There were three Voshinins in his church, I believe
four Chichillas&mdash;[spelling] C-h-i-c-h-i-l-l-a-s&mdash;and I think that was about the
whole parish.</p>

<p>And, after that, we did not have much contact with George. In fact, we
resented each other extensively. But, with the years, the resentment sort of
died out and now we are just very polite but not very friendly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do have social intercourse with George?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No, sir; I meet him at a party some place&mdash;at other people's
parties once in a while, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you employed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Self-employed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Self-employed?</p>

<p>And, when you first came here, were you employed by anybody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; I was employed by George De Mohrenschildt for half a
day and for half a day I worked for Henry Rogatz&mdash;both geologists. I stayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
with George, I believe, just 2 or 3 weeks maximum amount, as far as I can
remember&mdash;no longer than a month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this was in <span class="locked">19&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. 1955. I believe in November. Either end of October or November
in 1955.</p>

<p>And then I started working for Henry Rogatz, for whom I worked until June
1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you come to be sent to, or become acquainted with,
George De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. George Bouhe told me about him and he arranged it. And he
asked me to call George on the telephone. And I came there and George right
away offered me to be his secretary there and also to help him with his projects&mdash;drilling
projects, whatever he had there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Drilling projects?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; there was one drilling project going on and he wanted
me to participate in the geology.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you known this man theretofore?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No, sir; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then, after about 3 weeks of working half days for Mr. De
Mohrenschildt, you began full time for Mr. Rogatz?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. For Mr. Rogatz&mdash;right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Also, in your profession of geology?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you learn of De Mohrenschildt, De Mohrenschildt's
present wife, and De Mohrenschildt's prior history?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I don't know very much about De Mohrenschildt's prior
history&mdash;only what he, himself, told me. I mean, I can just repeat his own
words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. You start and tell us what he told <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then go from that to what you know of your own knowledge.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Sir, I'm afraid I don't know anything of my own knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Tell us all he told you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. He told me that he had some former wives&mdash;that he had a
wife, Dorothy, and a daughter, Alex, from this wife Dorothy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that daughter's name was Alex?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Alex. Right.</p>

<p>And then that he had a second wife&mdash;I believe he said her name was Washington,
or something like that. And I also believe that he said she was a
songstress or something like that. I'm not too sure, somehow. He never talked
about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. An entertainer of some kind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Entertainer of some kind&mdash;right.</p>

<p>And he never talked about her and I understand it was a very short marriage.</p>

<p>And then it was Dee Dee Sharples whom, just when I started working with
George, the trouble had started between Dee Dee and George. So, I never met
her. I talked to her over the phone a couple of times but I never met her
myself.</p>

<p>And then he separated from Dee Dee and he found&mdash;he met Jeanne
[pronounced Zhon]. I believe that he mentioned to me that he met Jeanne
before that time, though, I'm not certain when and how. No&mdash;I am certain
how, because he said he met her at the swimming pool at the Stoneleigh Hotel.
She was living in that hotel. And then they married, I believe, in 1959, after
those trips to Yugoslavia&mdash;two trips. I'm not sure whether he went two or once
to Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you living here in Dallas when he made his trip or trips
to Yugoslavia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes, uh-huh. We lived all the time in Dallas&mdash;all those years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you know about his trip to Yugoslavia&mdash;and start from
the beginning, as you recall it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Only what he told me about it. I remember very well that
he was getting an offer from somebody in Washington, D.C., to go to Yugoslavia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
And, somehow, George didn't like very much this idea, because he told me he
will go to Yugoslavia if he will have to go&mdash;something to that extent. I understood
that if he goes very well in money that, you know, his financial status
requires, he will go to Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>But, at that time, he was preferring to work in Texas and drill wells rather
than his foreign work&mdash;which he did later after he returned from Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>You see, there actually are two periods in George's life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Tell us about it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Before he went to Yugoslavia and after he went to Yugoslavia.
Because&mdash;of course, I might be quite wrong about it. This is my own
impression of the whole thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; well, that's what we want.</p>

<p>Now, you were living here in Dallas when he went <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Before he went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At the time he went to Yugoslavia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had these conversations with him about going to Yugoslavia
before he left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you know he went?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And I know he went; right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You know, by reputation, that he went to Yugoslavia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. What reputation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, by what was said. It was said that he went to Yugoslavia.
You do <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; but then he sent us postcards from Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. So, we knew for sure that he was there. And then he
brought back&mdash;that I know for sure that he went to Yugoslavia&mdash;and he
brought the photo pictures unmistakably Yugoslavian that he brought back&mdash;photographs,
you know, that were Yugoslavian.</p>

<p>Some of them I knew&mdash;some of the places.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You knew some of the places in Yugoslavia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was over there about how long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I thought he was there about a year&mdash;something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this was when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I think it was in&mdash;now, that I cannot place exactly. I think
in 1957&mdash;in 1956 and 1957; or 1957 and beginning of 1958. I'm not too sure.
But anyway, what I remember that in 1959&mdash;it was before 1959, because in 1959
we went to Fifth Petroleum Congress in New York City and there we met
George and his old friends from Yugoslavia. So, that would have been the
year before that that he went. There was a delegation of Yugoslavian geologists
who knew him&mdash;and he introduced us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you gathered, from those introductions and talking, that
they were people in the Yugoslavian delegation to the Fifth Petroleum Congress
who knew George?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Knew George very well; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did they speak of his having been there, or what was said
that led you to affirm that he had been in Yugoslavia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, for some reason, somehow we could not get together
with those people. We just&mdash;you know, it's not very easy sometimes to talk to
the people from behind the Iron Curtain. And I had definite feeling that they
were little bit afraid to talk to us&mdash;for some reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Because of your long stay in Yugoslavia, both you and your
husband could have spoken with them? You are familiar <span class="locked">with&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, they talked our own language. Certainly.</p>

<p>And we just&mdash;I just met the whole group once, and then one fellow was
there who was brought up also in Banat region&mdash;[spelling] B-a-n-a-t&mdash;which is
near the town of Panchevo, where I grew up. And he was very eager to talk.
And I had the impression that he was definitely afraid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Afraid to talk to you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. You know what he did? For some reason he would say&mdash;"Would
you like to get out into the corridor and meet me there and let's talk?"
And we would say a few words and they would come and he would immediately
cease talking, you know.</p>

<p>And then again, he would say it&mdash;and it was always in a crowd that he would
like so to talk. I don't know. That was just funny behavior&mdash;really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this Fifth Petroleum Conference was when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In 1959&mdash;end of May and beginning of June, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you going to tell us about the so-called second period of
George De Mohrenschildt's career?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, I would call it the second period because, first of all,
I must tell you that in between, somewhere in the middle of the second period,
we were not on speaking terms with George and Jeanne for over a year. So,
I cannot tell anything about that period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That was&mdash;well, from some cracks they made. I mean&mdash;no&mdash;well,
okay. It was a silly joke, I believe.</p>

<p>But Jeanne wanted to send a greetings telegram to Mr. Khrushchev, you
know.</p>

<p>Now, I don't know whether I made it clear to the gentlemen from the FBI.
So, I would rather say this now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. But she never sent this telegram. George told me she never
did send it. But, anyway, we were awfully angry at that&mdash;really angry. And
it was just&mdash;all that constantly, you know, and their talking in left <span class="locked">direction&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Their talking what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In left direction, I mean. They were liberals, you know,
and once in a while they were just unpleasant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was George De Mohrenschildt a liberal also, or was his wife
the liberal?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Wife was a liberal, definite; but George would talk&mdash;could
talk either way. George&mdash;well, if he would, for example, think that he could
knock you off your feet by saying something pro-Fascistic, he would do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Saying something what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Pro-Fascistic, you know&mdash;pro-Nazi.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Pro-Nazi?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; he would do that by all means. If he knew that you
are a middle-of-the-roader, he would praise Communists, you know. Communists&mdash;not
communism. In fact, I never heard George&mdash;not necessarily communism
itself. In fact, I never heard George praising the Communists' doctrine
even, you know, talking about it in several ways.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was a provocative personality, was he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He sought to provoke argument?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Exactly. And to say exactly the opposite. Something that
you will disagree, and start arguing. Exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He would take either side?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Either side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Always opposite to the other person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And yet, somehow, you know, he had that definite sympathy
for the&mdash;I would say, for the leftist regime; somehow&mdash;not in particular.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I wonder if I might ask a question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Did you all ever meet people named the Kelvin Fords?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Kelvin or Declan Ford? I met Declan Ford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I mean Declan. Excuse me.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Declan. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Do you know them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I don't know them very well. I knew her very well when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
she was married to her first husband&mdash;but not too close with her after she married
Declan. I just met them several times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Did you attend the Christmas party that they had?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No, sir; I did not&mdash;oh, wait a minute. That was not Christmas
party. That was New Year's party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. New Year's party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. This year's New Year's party; yes. We attended that.
Yes; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Did you meet Lee Oswald there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No, sir. That was after the assassination of the President
that we attended the New Year's party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, the one the year before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, no. We went elsewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me about George De Mohrenschildt's personality&mdash;other
than in this area of argumentation and provocation.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, I thought that he was a neurotic person. He had some
sort of headaches and sometimes he would flare into a rage absolutely for no
reason at all practically. And I knew that he complained to me several times
that he could not concentrate very well. And once he mentioned something
about seeing a psychiatrist or something. He had some difficulty on the nervous
background.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he unconventional?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Uh&mdash;what does that mean exactly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He didn't dress <span class="locked">normally&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's true; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He would come to church in shorts?&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He would walk into your home without invitation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Right. He was that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Sort of a beatnik?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, no; not beatnik&mdash;but he was definitely nonconformist.
He would just love to do exactly what people would, you know, object to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was not sensitive to the feelings of others?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Not at all. I believe that sometimes he definitely enjoyed
in teasing people in his own way. He used to&mdash;in any way. For example, if
people are not politically inclined, he would shock them with some statement
about a free marriage, you know. If they are politically inclined, it would
depend on who they are. The conservative, he would shock with communism,
you know; the Jewish people, he would shock by praising nazism, you know.</p>

<p>He was that type of person, you know, really, they were like children in that
respect&mdash;honestly. And what the trouble is with George and Jeanne, both
of them, I think, their main trouble is their extreme bitterness&mdash;extreme
bitterness, I believe which goes back to their former life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Bitterness?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Toward life, toward people, toward&mdash;you know, they thought,
for example, that almost everybody's a bigot. For example, Igor and I were
bigots because we went to church. You know, that sort of thing. And so and
so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were unreligious people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes, sir; they were actually fighting atheists.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were aggressive atheists?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Aggressive, definitely. And they would just state it in,
sometimes, quite rude form. One definitely would object against the form,
mainly&mdash;because, after all, everybody should have his own belief. There
is nothing criminal to be an atheist either, but the form in which they did it,
you know, the impoliteness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Did you ever notice that they tended to want to help people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. To help people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Were they the type persons that were always trying to help
someone that needed help?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; not always; uh-uh. But, I think that by nature, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
are very, very good natured&mdash;definitely. They're for the underdog, you know&mdash;always.
And&mdash;well, compared to George Bouhe, whose whole life is dedicated
to helping people whether people wanted it or not, you know&mdash;they would be
nonhelpful. You know, they would not bother so much about people as George
Bouhe did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They weren't aggressive about it as George Bouhe was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Right. But they were very&mdash;are very good natured.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And generous people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Not George&mdash;no. Jeanne, yes; but not George.</p>

<p>For example, their relation to Oswald. They definitely pitied him very,
very much. They were very sorry for him. And they tried to help him in any
way they could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, that you have mentioned the Oswalds, did you ever meet
either one of the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No, sir; uh-uh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you hear about the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In what connection did you first hear or read or learn about
their existence? Fix the time, first.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. My husband read it in the newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be in June of 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I really can't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They arrived here <span class="locked">in&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. They arrived here and there was an article in the newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. They arrived in New York on the 12th day of June 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I didn't know <span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I'm just telling you that that's so.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Uh-huh. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then your husband read an item in the local paper&mdash;about
what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. About them arriving here and from where did they come.
They came from Russia. You know that. They arrived here <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anything said in this article that arrested your attention
as to the circumstance of their coming, or his circumstance or happenings in
Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I don't remember very well whatever was there in the
article. I didn't read it myself. But what I heard of them was from my
friends&mdash;first, from the Clarks. And they told me some circumstances. They
told me that he was living in Minsk, I believe. But they didn't tell me anything
about his political nature. They just said that she is a very nice person, very
young, and he is boorish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Boorish?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Boorish. Has bad manners and arrogant. I don't know the
right English word for that. Arrogant, maybe. And, so, we decided that we
don't want to associate with him at that time.</p>

<p>And the second time I heard from them&mdash;no, between that time&mdash;between
Clarks and De Mohrenschildts&mdash;I heard from them some other people in
the St. Nicholas Church. They mentioned them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You said, I heard from those people about Oswalds&mdash;about two
Oswalds. Right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; and they were usually positive about her and somehow
uneasy about him. They liked her. And the only thing that I heard&mdash;the only
people that I heard about the political inclinations of Oswalds were De Mohrenschildts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In conversations with the De Mohrenschildts?&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They related to you their views as to Oswald's political inclinations?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did they say and who said it&mdash;which of them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. First of all, we did not discuss it. It was rather remarks on
George's side&mdash;because we asked George definitely and Jeanne not to bring him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
to our house and not to invite us when the Oswalds are there because we had
certain reasons&mdash;not evidence&mdash;but reasons to believe that he might be a Soviet
agent. Might be, you know. But not sure at all whether he would be or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Since there was in your mind a possibility, you didn't want to
have anything to do with them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. We wanted to stay away from them. Yes. And the De
Mohrenschildts argued with us about that. George would say always that he
was a very mild person, that he wouldn't hurt a fly. And, then, later&mdash;that was
at the beginning&mdash;that was at the very beginning&mdash;and then later, somehow, I
believe George started seeing through Oswald a little bit. That's my own opinion&mdash;impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you go ahead and talk.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Because he told me on several occasions that, "You know,
I believe that he's just an idealistical Marxist." And he said, "You know, he's
one of those pure Marxists." You know, meaning a Marxist in theory but not
in practice.</p>

<p>And finally I remember a pretty good conversation&mdash;George mentioned the
possibility of Oswald being actually a Communist. Because, he said, you know
Natalie, I believed that he remained what he was."</p>

<p>And I remember definitely that conversation because Jeanne took George
right away and she was protesting vigorously against that statement. And
she said that she does not believe that he is a Communist because he was very
disappointed with Mr. Khrushchev and Russia&mdash;and then, of course, for obvious
reasons, that doesn't mean that he is not a Communist if he is disappointed with
Khrushchev and Russia, you know. I remember that argument&mdash;but more than
that, I just can't say, because I just don't remember that far away the conversations.
But we got, again, you know&mdash;the picture was sort of shaping up
about Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You tell us in your own words what picture was shaping up about
Oswald. What did you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. By that, that we wanted to stay away from him, definitely for a
period. You know, that he was just&mdash;that he just was a dangerous person. For
this reason, first of all, Soviets seldom let anybody in unless they have certain
plans for that person&mdash;especially a person of non-Russian descent. Yet they
let him live there. Right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They let him in in the first place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In the first place. So, they must have had some plans for
him. He stayed there for a length of time. Right? I believe, 2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. He went there in September of 1959 and left in&mdash;oh&mdash;the
tail end of May or the first part of June 1962.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. 1962? So, it's three years. Right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Then, for these 3 years&mdash;this is all our own theory, we
have <span class="locked">no&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I know.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. You understand?</p>

<p>For these 3 years, he could have got his training? Right? Whatever it is.</p>

<p>Thirdly, his exit from Russia was so easy. With wife and children&mdash;with
child, wife, and with suitcases&mdash;no problem there. Which is absolutely unnatural.
Usually, American boys have such trouble getting their families out of
Russia. You probably remember the cases.</p>

<p>And, thirdly, we believed that&mdash;we were expecting, rather, to hear from
Oswald publicly some anti-Communist declaration, some, you know, reports,
lectures, or a couple of articles in the newspaper, you know, we expected from
him to behave like a person who got disappointed in communism, came here
sincerely&mdash;like people we know. For example, Eugene Lyons or Captain
Khokhlov, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Spell that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Let me write it (writes out name). So, his behavior after
he came here, from what we heard about his behavior, was unnatural. He was
sulky instead of being very happy that he is back. Right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. According to George, he was a great&mdash;he had great intellectual
power; he was very clever person&mdash;definitely intellectually inclined and
very well-read person; and that he was&mdash;he couldn't find a job. Now, wouldn't
that be natural for an intellectual person to go get his living lecturing against
communism?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you harkening back to your own <span class="locked">history&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes. I might have done it if I hadn't had my own profession.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That you were able to obtain positions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Everybody would be able to to obtain a position. Khokhlov,
he was in Washington, D.C., even, I believe. I don't remember exactly what
he was. But, anyway, all those people not only expressed their beliefs and
shared their beliefs publicly, you know, with other <span class="locked">people&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. But&mdash;the other point was that it would really help Oswald
materially, don't you think so, in a material way? He would earn some money.
Other people were earning their living by lecturing on anti-Communistic talk.
So, why did he have to sit jobless or to go to the factory&mdash;or whatever he did,
I don't know exactly, whatever work he worked&mdash;instead of going and lecturing,
which he never did. Right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. From what we heard of him he never expressed himself for
being anti-Communist. We remember that. We never heard a word of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it ever occur to you that his knowledge and his learning
was entirely superficial and he didn't have the capacity to lecture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Not never. Because George was so emphatic about his
mental powers, about his erudition, education, you know, that it really never
occurred to me. I thought that he was an intellectual, very well read. Because
George said that many times. He said, "He's a very interesting person, he's
very well read, a very intelligent person."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever argue this with De Mohrenschildt&mdash;say, "Well, why
doesn't he lecture? I don't understand this?"</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I remember I did ask that&mdash;and I don't remember the exact
answer. Whatever it was, I don't remember. But, as far as I remember,
they said something that maybe from the gratitude to Russia, or something
like that, he doesn't want to do that, and said they'd leave that up to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Did George De Mohrenschildt ever mention that Oswald spoke
fluent Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; he did. Uh-huh. He said that Oswald spoke very
good Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Did he ever discuss where he learned to speak Russian so fluently?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; in fact, he did not discuss or quote&mdash;I don't remember him
discussing extensively Oswald's background or quoting what Oswald said about
what. I tried to remember it yesterday very hard, you know, but just couldn't.
I just don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I wonder if I might ask an opinion of you here? If he were
working, say, in a factory or in normal pursuits in Russia for, say, 2 years,
would it be possible to become that fluent in Russian&mdash;just from the fact of
working&mdash;just from the fact of working there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I think so. Yes; I think so&mdash;because, after all, you rub
shoulders with Russian workers, you know, so you're in it all the time. It's
good that you ask the question, because there was one more suspicious thing
about Oswald. According to hearsay, his wife said that Oswald had a very
nice apartment in Russia&mdash;modern apartment. And they just don't give such
apartments to anybody. You know, they usually have to earn that to get it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Did she tell this to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No, sir; I never met her. But I heard from other people&mdash;I
think, Mrs. De Mohrenschildt said that, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That they had a very nice apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; that they had a very modern, nice apartment in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What would a nice apartment in Russia be? Just one room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What concept did you have in your mind when Mrs. De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
Mohrenschildt said to you, "They had a very nice apartment in Russia?" What
did you think they had?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I didn't think of apartment. I immediately thought of why
must they have it. I thought maybe he had a roomette with a bath and kitchen.
Something like that, you know. Certainly not nice according to our standards
here. That's for sure. But there was another little thing. Marina supposedly
mentioned that Russians did not like him; that his workers actually hated him.</p>

<p>And that was another hint to me&mdash;that why did they hate him? Usually,
Russians are very cosmopolitan people, you know. They like foreigners. Now,
why would they hate a guy? And I come to conclusion that maybe he reported
on them&mdash;or something like that. You know, little by little&mdash;but do you understand,
sir, that everything I say, taken separately, doesn't mean anything, probably.
But you just put it together and it sort of tells something to us, you
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You go right ahead. What you put together and what impresses
you, little by little by little, is helpful to me in bringing out the bases upon
which you had these views and opinions. So, don't be embarrassed about it
or hesitant. I want you to say, in giving these impressions, why, what you
base them on&mdash;and I understand that you are rationalizing.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Did you want to ask a question, Mr. Davis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Do you recall if George De Mohrenschildt ever mentioned to you the
fact that the Oswalds had been in Moscow for any period of time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; he never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. You don't recall anything about them being in Moscow?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I don't remember anyone mentioning them being in Moscow.
Wasn't this in some magazine or newspaper&mdash;or maybe his mother mentioned
it&mdash;his being in Moscow? Didn't she? I think his mother mentioned this in
connection with his seeing some CIA man with the American Embassy in Moscow.
I believe I did read something somewhere. Some of her gossip, you
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Some of her gossip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like to have you, when you're giving us these impressions,
however, give us your impressions as you had them as of the <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And not influenced by what you have learned and read since
November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that's what you are doing, is it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>We interrupted you. You were relating your rationalization as to your fear
or aversion to this person known as Lee Oswald, who had been in Russia and
had come to America with his wife and <span class="locked">child&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And why, in your mind at this time about which you speak, you
were fearful that despite Mr. De Mohrenschildt's attempted reassurances to you
that he, Oswald, wasn't acting like a person who was free of Russia, so to
speak, and had an aversion to Russia, who you expected to be doing some
things, here, such as lecturing and what-not, and these were things he wasn't
doing&mdash;from which you concluded you had some misgivings, at least.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. And have you recounted all of that now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have completed your rationalizing statement in that connection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Mrs. Voshinin, was there a period of time or a series
of occasions that troubled you and your husband with respect to the activities
of Mr. De Mohrenschildt and also his present wife with respect to trips to
Houston, Tex.?</p>

Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. It didn't trouble us actually, because we knew very little of
his business and we just were not very much interested in his business affairs&mdash;but
we just noticed that he was traveling to Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To Houston?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I mean to Houston. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were these regular?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Quite regular. And usually it would coincide, somehow, with
his next assignment. You see, you asked me to think at that time, prior to
November 22, 1963. At that time, it did not bother us at all. We just didn't
give much thought to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you noticed it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. We noticed it definitely. Yes. Because he was always expecting
some telephone calls from Houston. If they would be at our house,
for example, she would tell me that he give our telephone number, you know,
to call him&mdash;and it would be from Houston.</p>

<p>But he also was traveling so extensively that it was absolutely impossible to
remember everywhere where he went. I know that he went a lot to New York
on business; he went a lot to Philadelphia on his private business&mdash;private life.
Of course, that would include Dee Dee Sharples&mdash;concerning his third wife and
children. They had disagreement there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you and your husband have occasion to discuss these Houston
trips recently?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; recently. And we discussed also those Houston trips before
November 22&mdash;because our friends, the Jitkoffs, they mentioned to us that
they don't like George at all and they didn't want us to bring him to their house.
And I asked why, and she didn't want to tell exactly why, but she said something
about some people&mdash;some character whom he is visiting in Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Character?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you gather from that? Did she use the word "character"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; <i>Teep</i> [phonetic] is "type" in Russia. That means
"character" in English. You know, it means type of a person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I appreciate what you mean by character&mdash;but what
kind of a person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, unsavory character.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Unsavory character?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I understood politically unsavory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Politically unsavory?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Right. That's what I understood.</p>

<p>And also Mr. and Mrs. Jitkoff, on several occasions, expressed surprise that
we became friendly with De Mohrenschildts again&mdash;and I assumed that it was
on the basis of his visiting this particular person in Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they name the person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I don't remember their naming the person; no. But she
said something&mdash;I just don't remember, really, what she said. But we thought
that the Jitkoffs don't know George De Mohrenschildt too well, you know, and
that's why they might be little bit exaggerating, you know, the bad character
of George. Because, if you know him well, you can see why he thinks.
[laughing]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it occur to you or your husband, now that you reflect on the
matter, that the trips to Houston could possibly have had some connection
with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Never. No. In fact, we didn't think of Oswald very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am talking about your rationalizing last night <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No. It never did. No. I was quite certain that it had
something to do with his Haitian assignment. It was rather business trips.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do know that you were not aware of what the character
of his business was in Houston, if he had any?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You just assumed he had business in Houston?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes. That's right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I didn't know.</p>

<p>(Off-the-record discussion follows.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we have inquired of Mr. Voshinin about the famous walking
trip of the De Mohrenschildts from the border of Mexico and the United
States to Panama.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he make such a trip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. He says he did&mdash;and he brought some films and some photo
pictures&mdash;photographs and moving films, and on the moving film there was
that volcano eruption, you know&mdash;so I assume that he did make the trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you receive any cards from them as they wended their way
down?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; we were not on speaking terms with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, this is the period when you were not friendly?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And afterward, when they got <span class="locked">back&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. We met them at Ballens.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And some of the friendship was restored?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Right. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you did see moving pictures <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; of their jungle life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Jungle life, and in those moving pictures, were there pictures
of Mrs. De Mohrenschildt included?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; but, of course, it was either he or she&mdash;because one of
them was taking pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. But you saw representations in the movie film of <span class="locked">him&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When she was taking the picture or you assumed she was; and
you saw also <span class="locked">her&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the moving film when he was taking, or you assumed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Right; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you mentioned a volcano erupting. That drew your
attention to a particular incident, did it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; it did not. It only&mdash;you know what I was actually
wondering, for no reason at all, asking myself whether those pictures could
have been taken elsewhere but in Mexico, you know. But, then, when I saw
the volcano eruption, it sort of proved it, you know. Because I just couldn't
imagine that people would walk all that distance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The volcano eruption&mdash;did that sequence of frames in the
movie strip, did it include pictures of Mrs. De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; she was standing right at the flowing lava. It was a
very beautiful picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did the movie film also show him in that area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; Uh-uh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they say where the volcano was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I am not sure they said where it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yucatan?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I don't think it was Yucatan. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your best recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Somewhere near Parikutin, I believe. Somewhere there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Spell that, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. [Spelling] P-a-r-i-k-u-t-i-n&mdash;because this is one of the recently
erupted volcanoes in Mexico&mdash;Parikutin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. When was this event&mdash;the walking trip from the
border to Panama?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I don't know. Chronologically, you mean, when was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, give me the time, first, the year&mdash;as you best recall now.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I really cannot do that. Because it was in 1959 that Khrushchev
came to this country, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. I believe so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. So, before that, we broke our relationship, right? And we
restored it after the trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, the trip came after Mr. Khrushchev had visited
this country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Visited this country. And it was 1961, I would say. They
returned probably in 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall the incident of the attempted and ill-fated invasion
of Cuba?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. You mean, that President Kennedy <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Bay of Pigs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; the Bay of Pigs.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; I do remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when was this walking trip with respect to that event&mdash;at
the same time, a little bit before, a little after?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. You know, I couldn't say absolutely. I'm very bad on dates&mdash;and
I don't remember even the date of the Bay of Pigs. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you've put me in a bad spot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, it was in&mdash;shortly after 1960. It would be about March
of 1960.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The President was elected in November 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was very shortly after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, the invasion of the Bay of Pigs occurred after the President's
election, and my recollection is that it was in December, December of 1960,
or January of 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I think it was probably about that time&mdash;or in February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was sometime very shortly after he took office. During the first
2 or 3 months of 1961. It wasn't long after he had been inaugurated and he was
inaugurated January 9, I think it was, 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. The 20th is inauguration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Twentieth of January?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes. I think it was in late February or early March.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, that's reasonably accurate.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Uh-huh. Maybe they were in Haiti at that time. I don't
know really. Really, I'm afraid to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They might have been in Haiti?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In Haiti. Because I know that they told us that on the way
back, they stopped for about a month in Haiti to get their breath&mdash;to rest a little.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the way back from the Mexican walking trip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. From the Mexican walking trip; yes. They walked through
Panama, from there they took airplane to Haiti and stayed there a month&mdash;and
then came back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they ever say anything or did you ever have the impression
that they had visited Cuba?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No. No. But something&mdash;I think he did not visit Cuba. I believe
he mentioned that his plane had to stop in Cuba, something like that, on the
airport. But I'm not sure about that at all. I believe he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there a time when he visited Ghana?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. There was; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, that was after he came back from Yugoslavia. I don't
remember before or after he went second time to Yugoslavia. I think it was
before he went second time to Yugoslavia. And I am pretty sure that he was
in Ghana because he brought a newspaper&mdash;Ghana newspaper&mdash;and there was
a picture, small picture. I didn't read the article, but I noticed there a line
which said, "A well-known philatelist, George De Mohrenschildt"&mdash;which caught
my eye. So, I thought, my God! That's one of George's antics again!
[Laughter.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Was he a stamp collector?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. And this article said he was?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's what the article said; yes. But I just glanced through
it, I mean. That's what caught my eye. That's all.</p>

<p>And then he also brought some photographs from Ghana&mdash;so I'm pretty sure
he was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You saw some photographs from Ghana?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; from Ghana.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you saw this newspaper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; and I saw the newspaper&mdash;and I believe this newspaper
was in English. The French newspaper was from Haiti&mdash;right. And the
English one was from Ghana; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was a Ghana newspaper published in English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; in English language&mdash;written in English language. And
that's what it said there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever talk to him about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I believe so. I believe I asked him, and he said that he
went there on account of some Swedish, I believe, businessmen to look for
some oil leases, and he had to sort of conceal his profession, you know&mdash;that
this is a competitive business and you don't advertise you are geologists looking
for oil, you know.</p>

<p>But then, again, we, both of us, refrained from asking any questions of
George's trip because George repeatedly hinted that he was doing some services
for the State Department, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Of the United States; yes. And under those circumstances,
you just don't feel like asking him any questions, you know. And maybe I
assumed that, but he definitely hinted&mdash;made certain hints. He never said
that he is an employee, though, you know. For example, about his trip to
Yugoslavia, he would say, "I made it with the knowledge of the State Department."
You know. And then when he came back, he told us how he submitted
a written report there. And then on few other foreign trips, he also said
that&mdash;sort of, you know, hinted that that was what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What foreign trip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. He was traveling to Europe several times, I forget which.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yugoslavia, Ghana?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, let me have&mdash;I have it on piece of paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, you have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. [Referring to paper which she took from her bag.] Prior
to 1955, he told me, he was in Cuba. He was drilling there. That was before&mdash;long
before Castro. Right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. He was drilling some well&mdash;made some very good oil discovery
in Cuba.</p>

<p>Then he worked in Mexico. That's what he said. Prior to 1955 sometime.
Then he went to Yugoslavia from 1957 to 1958, I believe. That's what it says
here. Then he visited Europe back on his way from Yugoslavia. And he
brought some pictures from Poland, Sweden, and from France. Those three
countries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you recognize any of them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No, sir; I haven't been in either of this countries. And I
believe he went to Poland, he said, because, you know, he lived formerly in
Poland and he said he wanted to go there to just have a look at it. And then
he said that he went to France to meet his first wife and child. I believe she
is&mdash;I believe Alex was at that time in France. And he went to Sweden for
business matters. I understood that some Swedish people arranged the Ghana
trip of his.</p>

<p>Then, also, on the way to Ghana, he went to Europe. I believe he said to
Sweden again and then to Ghana. And then&mdash;I'm not sure whether he was
twice in Ghana or only once. I'm quite sure once he was there. Then, he went
to Haiti several times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were aware that he was making these trips. Now, whether
he actually made them or not, you don't <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Other than that he told you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; and then he disappeared, you know. And he would
tell us and then, of course, go away. But, for example, Ghana is quite certain,
I think, because of this newspaper&mdash;so, that's why. And, then, we saw him
off on the airport, of course, it didn't say "Ghana" on the airplane, I mean,
but&mdash;&mdash;[Laughter.]</p>

<p>And then I noticed he visited&mdash;he mentioned that he visited&mdash;I don't know&mdash;he
mentioned that he visited Guatemala and Dominican Republic sometime in
between.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Sometime in between what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In between his walking trip and 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was in between 1955 and his walking trip that he had
visited Guatemala and the Dominican Republic?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; he mentioned, at least, visiting them&mdash;but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you were aware of his absences from Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the general conversation in the community in which you
moved that he was making trips to the places that he purported to be making?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, upon his return, would he, in turn, recount his experiences
in these various places and countries?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Sometimes he would, yes; but he would never tell us what his
business there was. Nobody was interested in that anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. He wouldn't tell anything about it. But he would tell, yes;
about&mdash;he would sometimes bring photographs like he brought from Europe,
from Ghana, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, photographs that he had purportedly taken, or picture
postcards or things he had purchased?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; there were taken photographs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Ones that he took?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>And also, of course, he sent us a card once in awhile, Now, I don't remember&mdash;from
Yugoslavia we definitely got a card. Yes; we got a card from Sweden from
him; and from Haiti we got a card.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you got cards from <span class="locked">Haiti&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before this last Haiti trip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I believe so; yes; I don't remember very well; yes.</p>

<p>You know, when he went to Haiti to rest after his walking trip, we did not
get any cards from him then. But before that and then after they moved to
Haiti we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did get cards?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were aware of his departing for Haiti on this present sojourn
of his?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, yes; quite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us about that. When you first learned of it, what he said,
what she said, and then his departure.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. A few months before their departure, he told us that he is
working on getting a job with Haiti and that&mdash;I understood&mdash;that foreign aid
money was involved there and this was connected with the State Department
again. It was not just invitation of the Haiti Government.</p>

<p>And he worked on that for a few months, and he was traveling quite a lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Back and forth to Haiti?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Not to Haiti. I don't know where. Because sometimes he
won't even mention where he goes, just when&mdash;or sometimes on business trips.</p>

<p>Then, he went to Haiti to arrange the trip. He came back and he brought
from Haiti a newspaper in which&mdash;French newspaper&mdash;in French&mdash;and it stated
there about the survey which was given to De Mohrenschildt &amp; Co. I don't know
who the company is. And he brought also some statement from the bank he was
showing that he had some money deposited there. It wasn't a statement. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
was a letter from the bank saying that $20,000 was deposited in his name at that
particular bank, and I understand it was by Haitian Government. That's what
it was&mdash;as far as I remember.</p>

<p>Then, he said that he would like very much to invest some of his money in
sisal plantation&mdash;[spelling] s-i-s-a-l. You know, making in rope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; you use sisal to make rope.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And I asked him whether he was going just to manage sisal
plantations or not, because he was mentioning them all the time. He says, "No;
I want to invest some money into that."</p>

<p>And I understood that his intention was to settle down in Haiti. It's possible,
you know. He was looking for some country for some longer time to settle down
and live in that country. He was considering Costa Rica because he was there
on his walking trip and he liked it very much. And then he decided that Haiti
would be very nice place to settle down, also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This walking trip down through Mexico and Central and South
America, that was kind of a dangerous business, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes, I think so. And she said she was very ill on that trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In these movies, how were they dressed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. According to the film, he was wearing shorts and she was
wearing very torn dress&mdash;which looked like that Tarzan lady on the films, you
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And some of the pictures were her with scarcely anything on
[laughing], with very little dress on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you get the impression that this was deliberate because they
were apprehensive that they might be attacked as they walked?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Robbed, you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; robbed.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No, I thought it was more practical&mdash;because the branches
scratch and tear your clothing, and, you know, less clothing you have always it
is the better. However, they were traveling with a mule which probably would
be considered by Southern American robbers as valuable thing. So, they could
have been robbed. In fact, they were attacked at night once and had to shoot
it off. You know, they were shooting.</p>

<p>But, they were very poorly dressed because Jeanne told me that they were
taken in the cities for paupers&mdash;they were mistaken for paupers, and people
would lend them money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give them pesos?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes [laughing].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All of which, I am sure, Mr. De Mohrenschildt enjoyed thoroughly?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Tremendously [laughing].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, if you can remember any more, I wish you would tell us
about De Mohrenschildt's comments with respect to the Oswalds and the impressions
that you gained of the Oswalds&mdash;as to how they got along whether he
treated her well or poorly?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oswalds&mdash;his wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Treated very poorly. Because De Mohrenschildt told us
that he was beating her. Then, she ran away from him and De Mohrenschildt
tried to help her, you know, to settle down and to separate somehow, but then,
they reconciliated. And after the reconciliation, Jeanne mentioned twice that
Marina had blue eyes&mdash;was beaten again, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Black and blue eyes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anything said, that you can recall, of either of them returning
to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Either of whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Either of the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Returning to Russia? No; I don't remember. No; I don't
think so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No mention of the fact&mdash;if it was a fact&mdash;that Oswald wanted
Marina to return to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; I never heard that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or, that they both desired to return to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; I never heard that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just nothing at all <span class="locked">concerning&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Nothing at all concerning that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any conversation that came to your attention with respect to
Marina undertaking to have some command of the English language and the
reaction of Oswald to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; that was discussed by De Mohrenschildt. And George
thought that Marina wanted very much to study English and that Lee prevented
it; that he really was forbidding her to do that. And I remember that Jeanne
said something that he found some English book that she had, was trying to
learn English behind his back, and he was very angry.</p>

<p>Incidentally, that was again one of those things that was pigeonholed against
Oswald, you know. Because the why&mdash;you know, the reason that he gave.
Why would he want that?</p>

<p>Because, really, there was one more point that was very strange about Oswald&mdash;my
feelings were. He sort of wanted to cut off the communication of
Marina&mdash;even with Russian people. Because he was so unpleasant to Russians&mdash;to
those folks around who tried to help her, you know. He was quite
rude, quite unpleasant&mdash;and, for some reason, we got the impression that he has
a reason not to want her to communicate with people, to learn English, or to be
together with Russians.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about that. That's why I asked you
all the detail about your coming here, and how you became acquainted. This
was out of the ordinary, as far as the community in which you moved is
concerned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it that that community was Bouhe, De Mohrenschildts&mdash;and
however you may have liked or disliked them in their efforts, the attitude
always was to get everybody acquainted with everybody else as quickly as possible
and to assist them? Now, this would be especially true, for example, of
Marina&mdash;that you'd like to bring her into the circle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I really can't say because we are not very close with that
circle, St. Nicholas circle, you know&mdash;St. Nicholas Parish circle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I really am not thinking about that particular parish.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I'm trying to put the background to what was bothering you&mdash;that
the normal thing that you expected&mdash;would expect of these <span class="locked">people&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, yeah. I understand you now. Yeah. Quite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that he would bring her into acquaintance with those with
whom she would be able to converse, anyhow, in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And become acquainted, and then, through them, to learn or
otherwise to acquire facility with the English <span class="locked">language&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Quite; or send her to school, at least, you know. That's the
natural thing to do for us when we come to this country&mdash;you know, just do it
as soon as possible. Right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. And what did you understand with respect to her
education?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I understood that she was a pharmacist but she did not
have a higher education because she was too young in age and I believe that
George mentioned that she went 2 years to college. Now, that wouldn't be
college in Russia. It might be <span class="locked">something&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No. It would be something like junior college here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Juniors or something like that. It would give her technician
status rather than a specialist in pharmacology.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did there come to your attention, in moving about your friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
and the people here, her general level of erudition and education and intelligence
in comparison with his?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No. Now, of course, what I'm saying is hearsay, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I appreciate that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. But several people said differently. For example, I heard
from the ladies&mdash;from the Russian ladies of our parish that she was&mdash;you could
see that she comes from an intelligent family, from a nice, you know, well-educated
family. She has good manners and everything and she was quite a clever
girl. Now, then, that she was sort of, I thought, more clever than he was. You
know, some people who are more <span class="locked">developed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And more educated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And more educated. Yes. While George insisted on just
the opposite. He was absolutely impressed with Oswald's mental powers, for
some reason. And he sort of looked down at Marina, you know, a little bit.</p>

<p>So, I really don't know what to think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was the last you heard from the De Mohrenschildts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That was Christmas. We received a card from them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; it was in 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what contacts, if any, did you have with them prior to that
time&mdash;that is, while they were still in Haiti?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. With the De Mohrenschildts before Christmas 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, she wrote me two letters; I wrote her one letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you had any contact with the children&mdash;either of Mrs.
De Mohrenschildt or of Mr. De Mohrenschildt&mdash;recently?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, we were visited by her daughter&mdash;by Chris&mdash;twice.
Once it was before Christmas <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But after November 22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes. Right. It was about 3 weeks before Christmas, I believe,
or 2 weeks. And now they were recently here, just&mdash;they left on March
15. They left Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they say anything during the course of this social visit, or
visit here, about the De Mohrenschildts&mdash;George and Jeanne or Jean or Eugene?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, Eugenia is right. You know they said so much, I just
hate to repeat it because I just don't know how much they exaggerated. They
were angry with both of them and I just don't believe <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I don't want you to repeat all the personal things. I
wanted your overall impression, which you have now volunteered, that they
were angry with George De Mohrenschildt and Mrs. De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Angry in what sense?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Uh&mdash;they said that they were not very hospitable for one
thing and, for another things, they&mdash;well, they said that George and Jeanne
took a turn for the worse politically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, now, would you develop that, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I hate to do that, because I just don't know how true it all is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I understand that all you are doing is telling us what they said.
It is pure hearsay. I understand.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Pure hearsay of angry children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's what it is. Right?</p>

<p>Well, they said that the majority of their trouble with Jeanne and George
was because they were shooting their mouths off there&mdash;pro-left and against
United States&mdash;something to that effect; Chris said that George was making
the most&mdash;the funniest accusations&mdash;statements in public, you know, like at
cocktail parties, for example.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That he does not believe that Oswald murdered the President;
that he believes that rightwing or FBI, I am not sure&mdash;and this was, of course,
awfully shocking to children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He believed that the rightwing or the FBI what?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's what the children said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Murdered the President. That's what the children said and I,
frankly <span class="locked">don't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't put much stock in it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did the children express any opinion as to whether these were
rantings or nonsense <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Of course, they were outraged by the statement, like everybody
is. But what I want to say only that sometimes George gets so bitter
he doesn't know what he says; you know, just doesn't know what he says. So,
that's why I believe that you cannot approach George or Jeanne to this extent
with standard measures. You cannot measure them by standard measures at
all&mdash;what they say or what they do even. They require different measures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, that opinion on your part is something that we necessarily
must weigh. We are trying to find out about these personalities so we can
judge these things in the light of what they did, what they said, and whether
these are fulminations and ravings and rantings and nonsense. These things
come to our attention, Mrs. Voshinin, and we have to determine whether we will
undertake to run them down. The fact that they are rumors doesn't excuse
us from giving them <span class="locked">consideration&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I realize that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As to whether there is any fact involved in this hearsay and
<span class="locked">rumor&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I realize that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Even though you, as a dedicated and loyal American, you would
regard it as so ridiculous that it must be nonsense. That doesn't necessarily
mean that it is nonsense. And we have to exercise some judgment.</p>

<p>Now, I think I have pretty well completed my questioning of you. I would
like to make this inquiry of you, though, if you will permit.</p>

<p>Is there anything that's occurred to you that you think might be helpful
to the Commission in its investigation? It might be a source leading us to
something that might be helpful&mdash;that you would like to suggest to us? People
who might know, incidents that occurred that I haven't been able to stimulate
your recollection on? Anything at all that you think might be helpful in the
investigation of the matter of the assassination of the President, John F.
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I can't think of anything. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't think of anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No. I can't think of anything&mdash;people that might be useful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, people or incidents or anything occurred during all this
period that you've been covering that you think might be helpful? It might be
somebody different from the De Mohrenschildts or it might be an incident that
occurred.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. [Pausing before reply.] You know, I heard the rumors
that&mdash;like everybody else heard&mdash;which you have heard definitely&mdash;but I don't
know anybody whom to trace those rumors to you know. That's the trouble.
I don't know any particular person who could throw any light on that thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; all right. We have occasionally been off the record and
had some discussion during the course of this examination, is there anything
that you reported to me or we discussed in the off-the-record discussions that
you believe is pertinent to the investigation or to your testimony, which I failed
to bring out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; I think that we covered the ground pretty thoroughly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there anything that took place in those discussions that you
would regard as, in any degree, inconsistent with any of your testimony, which I,
in turn, failed to bring out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I don't quite understand that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, what I'm getting at is this: Is there anything in the discussions
which we had off the record while you were in this room that you
think was inconsistent with your testimony as I brought it out that ought to be
on the record?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I don't remember very well what was off the record and what
was on. But I don't think so. I think everything was on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. You think I have brought out everything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Everything; yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Voshinin, you have the privilege and possibly I should also say
the right&mdash;I must say the right&mdash;to read over your deposition when it has been
transcribed by the reporter&mdash;which we hope will be next week. Either I will
be here or other representatives of the Commission will be in Dallas for at least
the next 2 weeks. You and your husband call in and ask for Mr. Barefoot
Sanders, the U.S. attorney, and he'll know when your deposition is ready for you
to read, if you wish to read it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then perhaps, in reading it, other things may occur to you or
the transcription may not be as you recall you said something, and you will want
to make some change. And you may have a copy of your deposition by arrangement
with this young lady, who will afford you and your husband a copy of your
respective depositions at whatever her regular rates are.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you may purchase one. Your husband, I should say, expressed
a desire to have his and put it in the safety deposit box [laughter].</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. A historical document!</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Voshinin, thank you so much. I hope you didn't think I
was probing into your personal affairs or pressuring you too severely.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; not at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. And I enjoyed your accent immensely. It has brought back very
wonderful memories for me.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>The testimony of Igor Vladimir Voshinin was taken at 9 a.m., on March 26,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Albert E. Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of
the President's Commission. Robert T. Davis, assistant attorney general of
Texas, was present.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Voshinin, would you stand and be sworn, please?</p>

<p>Do you swear, in your testimony here, to tell the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your name is Igor Vladimir Voshinin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Voshinin, the Presidential Commission appointed to investigate
the assassination of President Kennedy desires to inquire of you
with respect to any part you may have played in, or persons you may have
known here in Dallas or in the Dallas area, who had some contact with Lee
Harvey Oswald, or information that you might have that would help the
Commission in its investigation of this horrible tragedy.</p>

<p>Have you received a letter from J. Lee Rankin, the general counsel of the
Commission, with which was enclosed copy of Executive Order No. 11130,
creating a Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Senate Joint Resolution No. 137 of the Congress of the
United States authorizing the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And a copy of the rules of procedure of the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am Albert E. Jenner, Jr., member of the legal staff of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
Commission, and have been authorized by the general counsel to proceed to
take your deposition.</p>

<p>You reside where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. 3504 Mockingbird Lane in Highland Park, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is Highland Park a suburb of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's right; but it is an independent community.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; how long have you resided in Highland Park, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Since 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Prior to that time where did you reside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In University Park.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Also a <span class="locked">suburb&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. An independent community and suburb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And for how long did you reside there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, since 1957, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Now, it may be late in 1956.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your business or occupation or profession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I am a professional engineer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And by whom are you employed, or are you an independent
engineer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. At this time I am employed by Mullen &amp; Powell, consulting
engineers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you spell that name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. [Spelling] M-u-l-l-e-n &amp; P-o-w-e-l-l.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What area of engineering do you direct your attention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In structural engineering.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you a citizen of the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By naturalization or birth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. By naturalization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when were you naturalized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I have to see [looking through billfold]. It must be 1954&mdash;I'm
sorry to delay you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, take it easy. We have plenty of time. Don't let it worry
you a bit.</p>

<p>(The witness hands card to Mr. Jenner.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. [Reading] March 7, 1955?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the light of that, Mr. Voshinin, in what country were you
born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I was born in Russia before the Revolution.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how old a man are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I was born in 1906&mdash;so, therefore, I am 58 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are 1 year older than I am. I'll be 57 next June. And did
you alone, or your family, come directly to the United States from Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Without detail, tell us how you came to this country and
approximately when.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, we were living in southern Russia, which was in the
hands of the White Army, and when the Communists advanced, since we were
close, our family left from a port on the Black Sea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That was in 1920&mdash;early in 1920.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were then 14 years old, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Thirteen&mdash;yeah.</p>

<p>Me and my mother we left first for Greece and then to Turkey, and my father
left directly to Turkey and we met in Constantinople, now Istanbul in Turkey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And, after that, we altogether went to Yugoslavia where we
lived up to this last war.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">1940&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In 1942, the Germans forced me to go to work to Germany, and
actually, I jumped their train and remained in Austria close to Yugoslavia.
And after&mdash;by the end of the war when the Communists were close, you know,
we moved further west and somehow managed to come to <span class="locked">Kempten&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. To Kempten in south Bavaria&mdash;[spelling] K-e-m-p-t-en&mdash;and
that's where we met the American Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What you mean is that the American Army in its advance
reached the Bavarian area and freed you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, the American Army came to Kempten on 25th of April
and we reached Kempten on the 12th of April. So, I was just 13 days in
Germany before the American Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what is your wife's name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Natalie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where did you marry her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Belgrade, Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. It was in 1940.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; I have no children. I have only my father here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you come to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Uh&mdash;it was November 12, 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your wife accompanied you at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you settled where in this country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. We settled first in New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. New York City, for some time, then we mostly lived in New
Jersey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you receive a higher education&mdash;that is, an education beyond
high school equivalent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you tell us what that was, please, and where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I have bachelor degree in civil engineering from the University
of Belgrade, 1931, and the master degree in civil engineering from the
Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, in 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute is in New York City,
or its environs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's right&mdash;in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have pursued your profession in civil <span class="locked">engineering&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Since 1931, up to now&mdash;except for the time of war.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you give me the dates again when you were in Yugoslavia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. From the middle of 1920 to 1942.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1942? Is that when the Germans sought to bring you to Germany
and you escaped then to Austria?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was an escape, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, it was a little illegal [laughter]. Because they dragged
everybody to the Rhine, you know&mdash;and somehow I managed, with other people,
to get out of that train. There were hundreds of people who got out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Did you stay in Austria, then, throughout the war?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; almost out through the war.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Austria was occupied by the Germans also, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Austria was occupied also as well as Yugoslavia. And, of
course, you had to go to the labor office&mdash;because otherwise I would be arrested
immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. When you'd go there, they'd let you stay in Austria?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. You see, every labor office was grabbing for labor force&mdash;whoever
would come, you know. And, therefore, they would not disclose your name
to the next labor office, you know. So, I&mdash;when I got out of the train with two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
other fellows&mdash;and, of course, it has cost us something; it wasn't for free, you
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had to do a little bribery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah, to three persons there&mdash;including the guard which was
taking, as we were explained, cigarettes. When we came out, we had seen
about a hundred people who did the same thing&mdash;so, it probably was going&mdash;big
business there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. When did you come to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. 1955&mdash;about the first of September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were naturalized in New York City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No, sir; in New Brunswick, N.J.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, New Brunswick, N.J.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. New Brunswick, N.J. Yeah. We mostly preferred to live
in New Jersey, you know. It's a little better air. I'm an asthmatic, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You're asthmatic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah; I'm asthmatic&mdash;and, therefore, I have to choose my
climate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Voshinin&mdash;was she likewise born in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's right. Only she's 12 years younger so when her parents
took her out of Russia, then she was 1 year old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She probably wouldn't remember then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. She doesn't know anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when you came to Dallas in September of 1955, had you
had any advance acquaintance with anybody here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; I knew two persons whom I met through the church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what church is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Uh&mdash;the church in Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the name of it and what is its denomination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Greek Orthodox Church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Greek Orthodox Church?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; I don't know what the church's name is. I think it's
St. Vladimir&mdash;but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. St. Vladimir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah; I think so&mdash;but I'm not quite sure that was the name.
And the thing is that we wanted to settle in Houston <span class="locked">first&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. But we didn't like the climate. And the people there they
gave us the name of Mr. Raigorodsky&mdash;Paul Raigorodsky.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Spell that last name, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. R-a-i-g-o-r-o-d-s-k-y.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is he of Russian descent&mdash;or Yugoslavian or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah; Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He had preceded you to this country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. He was the first Russian immigrant who settled here in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And he is a millionaire&mdash;a very rich man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you known him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; we didn't know him personally but the priest there, the
pastor, you know, of our denomination in Houston said that when you go to
Dallas&mdash;we said that we passed through Dallas going to Houston and we said
we liked the climate much better and it's too humid there. So we said, "Well,
you know, we go to that city, we may settle there, but we don't know anybody."</p>

<p>So, he said, "Well, why don't you&mdash;we have two men who are able to help
you&mdash;and this is Mr. Raigorodsky and Mr. Bouhe&mdash;George Bouhe." The Russians
are referring&mdash;joking about Raigorodsky&mdash;they call him, "the Czar," here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. So&mdash;he's an old man&mdash;and so when we came, then the next
day&mdash;it was during our vacation in 1955&mdash;and so we went to see Raigorodsky
and then we went to see Bouhe. And they told us that there is a church of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
denomination here on McKinney and a few other just useful things&mdash;nothing
in particular.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Well, the main thing I wanted&mdash;when you came to
Dallas, you didn't know anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You then became acquainted with Mr. Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Bouhe&mdash;and Mr. Raigorodsky. Mr. Raigorodsky we kind of
liked&mdash;and Mr. Bouhe we kind of disliked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Was there any special reason for that other than <span class="locked">just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, Mr. Bouhe, he likes to help people but he likes to mix
in their <span class="locked">affairs&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Their personal affairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And tell them what to do and what not to do. And I don't
need a nurse here now. I like to listen to people's advice but I don't like to
have a nurse. I'm grown up. That's why I don't like&mdash;didn't like his approach
too well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Bouhe, while a well meaning and helpful man, he was a little
aggressive in your personal affairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah. Well, he is with everybody. He is an old bachelor, you
know, and he doesn't have anything else to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I inquire with respect to that&mdash;your aversion, at least initially,
to Mr. Bouhe was confined to the fact, was it not that you thought him a
little too aggressive insofar as your personal affairs&mdash;particularly advising you
and directing you as to what to and what not to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes. Well, everybody complaining the same way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes. Although I don't mind him helping people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Specifically, however, that aversion has nothing to do, has it, with
any political views that Mr. Bouhe may entertain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I mean "political" in the sense of his views on government&mdash;communism&mdash;conservatism&mdash;whatever
it might be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No. But my impression is that he is rather conservative&mdash;in
Russian politics, I mean. He always talks about the Czarist times and about
the times his father was some big shot somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you regard him, however, as a loyal American?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Uh&mdash;well, I don't know. We never talked about any American
politics with him. So I regard him as far as I don't have any proof otherwise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't suspect him, however, of any Communist affiliation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well&mdash;uh&mdash;one is accustomed to suspect everybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, no more than that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. But&mdash;uh&mdash;no more than that, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, your acquaintance with people here in Dallas broadened,
did it not, as time went on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it that, initially at least, your acquaintance was largely
among that segment of the community or society here of people from Russia,
Yugoslavia, and Central European countries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah&mdash;and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lebanon, also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah&mdash;well, those people who come to church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your acquaintance, initially, was among church <span class="locked">folks&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who attended your church?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was the Greek Orthodox Church here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; the Greek Orthodox Church, here on McKinney Avenue&mdash;because
there is another Greek Orthodox Church on Swiss. That's the church
where all the Greek people go, and all the non-Greek people went on McKinney,
because on McKinney the service was in the English language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the name of the parish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, there were two parishes there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. On McKinney, there were two parishes in one church. One
was called the St. Nicholas Parish and the other, the St. Seraphim Parish.</p>

<p>The St. Seraphim Parish is the English-speaking parish where the services
were in English. And at most times that's the parish who held their services
there; whereas the building belonged to St. Nicholas Parish&mdash;who had their
services once in 5 weeks, with their pastor coming from Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was <span class="locked">Father&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Father Alexander.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the Father of the other parish is Dimitri?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Father Dimitri Royster.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Royster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And the St. Nicholas Parish secretary-treasurer is Mr. Bouhe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. He's the motivating force, is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. He's the motivating force there&mdash;and everything [laughter].</p>

<p>Our sympathies switched very quickly to St. Seraphim Church and I became
a member of the church council there at St. Seraphim and&mdash;uh&mdash;I didn't like to
be a member of St. Nicholas any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that largely because of the aggressiveness of Mr. Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And because of the irregularity of the church meeting once in
5 weeks&mdash;and many other things&mdash;and because I believe that the church in this
country should be in the language of the country. I think it's natural&mdash;it's what
it should be in order that our denomination can exist at all&mdash;because in two,
three generations, the people lose their national language, and then there is
no church. Besides that, uh&mdash;I&mdash;what did I want to say? Besides that, I don't
think that's a good idea to divide Christians by their language in thousand and
one churches. We have people of six or seven national backgrounds and is&mdash;it's
absolutely senseless in serving the service in some other language than the
language in which everybody can understand. And, therefore, we switched to
the St. Seraphim Church&mdash;of which we have remained members up to now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were these two parishes and the church itself&mdash;that is, the Greek
Orthodox Church consisting of the two parishes&mdash;is that the medium through
which in large part the emigre group, let me say&mdash;from Russia, from Yugoslavia,
<span class="locked">from&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Lebanon; yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Became acquainted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; yes. Everybody knows everybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Everybody knew everybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And all rumors and everything else passed back and forth
through this group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is it true that arising out of this common interest in the
Greek Orthodox Church and the two parishes that a measure of social intercourse,
apart from the church, was also generated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; that is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you people generally became acquainted, one with the other,
in not only your church activity but your general social activity as well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah&mdash;well, I wouldn't say "general" social activity, because,
in addition to the church, I meet people through my office and my wife met them
too, so&mdash;but partially, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. At least, through that medium, whether you wanted to or
not you sort of kept track of everybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Everybody knew something about what the other fellow was
doing or would like to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah&mdash;and as far as I know Mr. Bouhe even kept files and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
still keeps files on everybody&mdash;when anybody was born, baptized, or whatever
happened to everybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. He even showed me a file and he said, "Say, you came here,
I immediately opened a file on you."</p>

<p>I say, "What for?"</p>

<p>And he say, "Well, you know, I forget things&mdash;so I keep a file on everybody."</p>

<p>Then, later, the parishes separated, as you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The parishes separated. Yes. I've heard that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Because, somehow, their life together, you know, became unbearable
and finally the St. Seraphim Church decided to move out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of that building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Of that building on McKinney. And we bought a house on
Newton and Throckmorton, as you know.</p>

<p>And the St. Nicholas Church remained within empty house which they only
used once in 5 weeks; so they decided to sell it and they sold that house and it
was torn away&mdash;torn down. And now there is a Gulf station on McKinney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A Gulf gasoline station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah; and they are still holding their church meetings at the
house of Mr. and Mrs. Tsinzadze (phonetic).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Hold it. Can you spell that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, I don't know how to spell that. This is a Georgian name.
These are Georgian people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By "Georgian," you <span class="locked">mean&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. From Georgia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From the Georgia part of Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah. It's the [spelling] T-s-i-n-z-a-d-z-e, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's good enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And we have been perhaps two or three times since that in
Tsinzadze's house&mdash;because my father, I think, goes to confession there. He
cannot go to the English confession. He prefers to have his confession in the
Russian language. So, they still have, a pastor coming there&mdash;but not from
Houston. That pastor who was in Houston is now in Johannesburg, South
Africa. And they have a retired pastor from Galveston&mdash;from the Galveston
Greek Orthodox Church&mdash;who comes there once in 5 weeks or so and they have
services.</p>

<p>So, perhaps once in the year we go there&mdash;or twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Voshinin, this is very interesting to me. Would you describe
this community of people in your own words? Tell me about the community
as a group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. St. Nicholas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; the whole&mdash;this <span class="locked">Russian&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. They are not only Russians there. Of course, Russians&mdash;you
said Russians&mdash;Yugoslav, Lebanese&mdash;but in addition to that, there are
those people&mdash;Estonians and Latvians. You see, there are a lot of Latvians and
Estonians who are Greek Orthodox. Well, you see, there is a national differentiation
now&mdash;yeah&mdash;in addition, I can take another nationality. These
are people&mdash;west Ukrainians and Carpathian Russians. These people have
former Austrian citizenship and Polish citizenship. They come from that part
which is known as Galicia.</p>

<p>So, nowdays, the people who are in St. Nicholas parish&mdash;we call that "Bouhe's
parish," in our usual usage of language. That's what we usually call Bouhe's
parish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He's still the secretary of that parish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. He's still the secretary of that parish&mdash;yeah.</p>

<p>These people are mostly those Baltic people there, with few Russians. There
are perhaps about 5 Russians there and about 15 to 20 Estonians and Latvians.
That is St. Nicholas though, whereas the St. Seraphim Church has a much
wider, of course, background because there are Russians there, there are
Yugoslavs&mdash;it's true that Bouhe's group has some Yugoslavs but they never
come to his church&mdash;not very often at least&mdash;very rare; but they come to us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
too&mdash;so I don't think they are members any place&mdash;those to which I'm talking
about.</p>

<p>But in our church there are a lot of&mdash;well, not too many Russians there&mdash;not
many people with Russian background in our city at all; but we have
those called Carpathian Russians and West Ukrainians and we have some
Serbians&mdash;people with Serbian backgrounds; we have some Greek people even;
we have all the Arabic people here&mdash;you know, Lebanese and other Arabic
countries which are Greek Orthodox; and we have American people with just
plain Anglo-American background who became members.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who became interested in the Greek Orthodox Church?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh, huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Our pastor himself, was a former Baptist who, through study
of church history, became Orthodox.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is this group&mdash;and I'm going to call the group both Bouhe's
following as well as the group in which you move&mdash;are they, by and large
people who have enjoyed higher education either in this country or in Europe,
or Asia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; in Bouhe's group there are only a few people with higher
education; whereas, in our group, I would say there is a lot of people with
higher education. We have doctors and engineers <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These people, I take it, are interested in the welfare of others
in the group&mdash;in the general sense of the word?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, did there move into this community or come into this
community that we have now described largely in terms of church, some people
by the name&mdash;or a man by the name&mdash;whose last name was De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes&mdash;except that he is an atheist and doesn't believe in God.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, he is an atheist&mdash;but he did arrive on the scene or he was
on the <span class="locked">scene&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, he was on the scene for a long time before we arrived
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; he was here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you came here then, in September 1955, you found De
Mohrenschildt already here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was he active among these people&mdash;even though, as you
say, he's an atheist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, he was singing in the church choir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was singing in the church choir even <span class="locked">though&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. At St. Nicholas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Even though he was an atheist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, that's rather unusual. How did that strike you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, it struck me unusual but he said he was educated in
that religion and somehow by habit continued coming once in awhile to
church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Even though he didn't believe in church?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, he said he doesn't believe in it <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was De Mohrenschildt married at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. To the Sharples girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What are they&mdash;Quakers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes, I guess so. Dee Dee, I think, was her name. I don't
know what it stands for. She was a medical doctor&mdash;his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you know of De Mohrenschildt's background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Only what he told me, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was said by others in this community of people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; something what was said by others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. You give me his background as you learned it by
reputation among the people you have described.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Well, De Mohrenschildt comes from a Swedish family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean, by reputation, he was born in Sweden?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No. He was born, as I heard, in Baku in Azerbaijan. This
is part of Southern Russia and Baku is in Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And I understand that his father was a nobleman and born
in Russia somewhere from Swedish parents&mdash;and that he was a rich man
<span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His father was a rich man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; and they had some big land, too, and probably some
other interests which led him to go to Baku, because Baku is the oil town in
Russia.</p>

<p>So, probably a very substantially rich man.</p>

<p>As he said, during the revolution, his father was arrested&mdash;I don't know
by whom&mdash;and I think his mother, too, as I understand, and he, as a small
boy, was running on the streets, was completely wild and hungry. And then
his father somehow managed, and his mother, managed to get out of prison,
and they moved to Poland.</p>

<p>He told us that he got his high school education in Poland and then went
to the military school in Poland and finished the military school and became
a Polish cavalry officer&mdash;and he was proudly showing his picture, you know,
of him on a horse in a wonderful uniform. So&mdash;but, somehow, he did not like
the military life, so he resigned and went to school in France and Belgium,
I guess, and, as he told us&mdash;I never saw his diploma&mdash;but he told us he has
a Ph. D. degree in economics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From a school in Belgium?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Belgium or in France. I don't know. I&mdash;you know, I don't
like to question people too much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No. All you're doing is giving me what he said and what is at
large in the community we talked about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah. So&mdash;but I don't know exactly, you know, if I would
think if it would be of interest for anybody I would try to remember, of course,
better but&mdash;somewhere, I don't know. He probably told me from which school
it was, but I don't remember.</p>

<p>After that, he decided to emigrate to the United States, came here and saw
that what he learned was of no use, so he went to school again&mdash;and he went
to school in Austin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Austin, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Austin, Tex.&mdash;and in Colorado. Now, whether it was Colorado
the University or Colorado the School of Mines, I don't know. But he finally
became a petroleum engineer. As I understand, he earned his master's degree.</p>

<p>After that, he went to work in some southern American country or&mdash;I think
he was sometime in Mexico and in some other country&mdash;I think it was Venezuela,
which I'm not sure again, it might be something else. And&mdash;uh&mdash;then I think
he returned here again during the war.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's the Second World War?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; during the Second World War, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say, "returned here," do you mean returned to the
Dallas area or to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. To the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. What he did during the war, I don't know; but, after the
war, he was working for some oil company. I think he had connections with
the oil company in which his father-in-law, Sharples, had some interest&mdash;because
he was receiving some money from that company even after he divorced his
wife&mdash;until it finally stopped. But he was&mdash;I remember that he was saying,
"Well, they stopped my money I received from the Sharples Co." He says,
"Now, they got me with this thing. I am not a consultant any more."</p>

<p>He was some kind of consultant for that company&mdash;I don't know what of, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
company's, that is. So, therefore, you know, I learned that he had received that
all the time though. I don't imagine it was too much money, but helping him.</p>

<p>And, finally, he wanted to go on his own and make money the whole time,
you know. So, he opened his own office and was drilling for oil and made also
some consultations. And I know that before we came here he was very successful
in the Caribbean area, and he got big money&mdash;real big money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is by reputation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah; but he always was bragging about him finding oil somewhere.
I don't know whether it was Cuba or Haiti. I think it was Cuba.
But that must be in 1953&mdash;something like that&mdash;because I know he was always
running around talking about income tax on that money because it was such
a deal outside the country, you know, present certain difficulties and you have
to ask the lawyers, you know, which year you receive that and so on.</p>

<p>So, he was always consulting some specialist about what to do about that
sort of thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is what he said anyway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's what he said anyway. I was never in business with
him&mdash;so I don't know.</p>

<p>So, shortly after that, after we came here&mdash;you see, how we met him, my
wife is a geologist with a Master Degree from Rutgers University; and we were
looking, you know, when we came through this area, we were looking for such
a place which would be good for my health and which also would give her the
possibility to work in her profession&mdash;and not be so noisy as New York is. So,
she was looking for a job&mdash;which was very difficult for a beginner, you know, a
woman geologist&mdash;though we have a dozen of them here. But&mdash;so Bouhe gave
us&mdash;he said, "There is a Russian geologist"&mdash;so Bouhe gave my wife the address
of Mr. De Mohrenschildt's office. He has a very good&mdash;beautiful office in
First National Bank. <span class="locked">So&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that's how you met De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's how we met De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>So, my wife worked there for <span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She worked in his office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah, for half a day&mdash;part-time.</p>

<p>Mr. De Mohrenschildt, he was very nice and he said, "Well, I don't have anything
but you can&mdash;I want to bring my files in order, you know, and you help me
a little so for sometimes I can give you something to start with&mdash;and I have a big
friend of mine, Mr. Henry Rogatz, who is looking for an assistant. So, he called
him on the telephone and he said, "I have an assistant for you, it's a girl, she
can help you in geology and all your work."</p>

<p>So, Henry hired my wife for that first month at half-day&mdash;she worked half a
day for De Mohrenschildt and half a day for Rogatz. And my wife only worked
for De Mohrenschildt, I think, 2 or 3 weeks and then she moved to Rogatz' office
and worked there for the whole day until he retired&mdash;which was about a
year and a half ago. So, all that time, my wife worked for Henry Rogatz.</p>

<p>And De Mohrenschildt, in that winter, divorced his wife and closed his office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What year was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, he divorced his wife&mdash;that was 1956, I would say, and
he had trouble with his wife, I think, beginning in that winter&mdash;1955 or 1956&mdash;and
finally he divorced her and after&mdash;sometimes after that he also closed his
office. I don't know which year exactly he closed his office but that must be
around 1956.</p>

<p>And then he&mdash;after he closed his office, he told all of us that he is no more
interested in opening another office because that's too hard for him because he
has, you know&mdash;he had some kind of accident, as I understand, and he cannot
drive too long, he cannot sit too long, and he has difficulties to concentrate&mdash;and,
therefore, he has to have an office where he can&mdash;you know, some job which he
can walk a little, consult a little, talk a little, but not too much paperwork.
That's what he explained to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not follow a regimen&mdash;be there at 9, have lunch at 12, come
back at <span class="locked">2&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah. He says he has difficulties doing that&mdash;just physical
difficulties, so he said that he decided to work&mdash;to look for foreign assignments;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
he said that the Government has that Foreign Aid Program and in connection
with that he will be able to find some kind of job like that and he says he will go
to Washington and there are some kind of agents called 5-percenters in Washington
who you can&mdash;if you find the right man you will get a job.</p>

<p>So, he was traveling back and forth to Washington and so on, and finally he
said he got a job in Yugoslavia; he doesn't like it too much because he's a little
afraid going there but he doesn't have any other way out because he's broke.
So, he went to Yugoslavia and stayed there for about a year. So, that <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he married then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; he was not married at that time.</p>

<p>Before that, he met that so-called Mrs. Le Gon, who posed as a French woman,
And he met her at the swimming pool of the Stoneleigh <span class="locked">Hotel&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He met her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. He met her at the swimming pool of the Stoneleigh Hotel&mdash;because
he was living at the Stoneleigh Hotel after his divorce and she was
living <span class="locked">there&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. He was living there after his divorce&mdash;and she was
also living there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. She was also living there&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>She was, as I understand, a fashion designer, and she traveled to different cities
to sell her ideas, you know, for design. She went to New York to sell&mdash;her permanent
residence, as I understand, was Los Angeles or some suburb thereof. But
she used to come here and sell her fashion designs to somebody called Clarke, I
guess. She was&mdash;so, she was temporarily here but pretty often. So, they met
there and fell in love, you know, and though she is Russian, of course, she would
not say a word Russian; she would talk English with a French accent and saying
she was a French woman.</p>

<p>Up to now, I think Mr. De Mohrenschildt does not know everything about his
wife. He told me two times that there is something that he doesn't understand
in her former life and he says that's the part before she came to the United
States; and he says the moment he tries to question her about that&mdash;because he
says, "It's my wife, I want to know,"&mdash;he says she's just mute; she doesn't want
to talk about it at all.</p>

<p>And we know, for example, that every time she meets some Russian from China,
she doesn't want to talk to them at all. What it was, I don't know&mdash;and even
De Mohrenschildt told me he doesn't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is she reputed to have been born in or to have lived in China?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; she is. She was born somewhere in China. Her father's
name was Fomenko, she said&mdash;[spelling] F-o-m-e-n-k-o&mdash;who was an engineer
on the East Chinese <span class="locked">Railroad&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Can you describe De Mohrenschildt's personality?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, do you want the further travelings as far as I know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. So, after&mdash;well, he went to Yugoslavia in the middle of that
year. When he was in Yugoslavia, she went to visit him there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His present wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. His present wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, at that time, his present wife was not his wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. They were very much in love, you know&mdash;and her husband
who was here two times and he was chasing De Mohrenschildt, and George De
Mohrenschildt says, "He will kill me with a revolver"&mdash;and there was some kind
of&mdash;we took it more or less of a joke, you know, just as very cheap movie film.
But George De Mohrenschildt was so much afraid that he even slept in a motel
somewhere, not in his Stoneleigh apartment. And, then, her husband, also, as I
understand, hired a detective who was running constantly De Mohrenschildt&mdash;and
all kinds of things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A lot of cloak and dagger?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah&mdash;cloak and dagger stuff. So after that, they divorced&mdash;she
divorced her husband&mdash;and, you know, he is now in an insane&mdash;had some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
kind of nervous breakdown after that, and he is now in some kind of insane
asylum or sanitorium, I don't know what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In California; yes. Bogoiavlensky is his actual name, not
Le Gon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why don't we get your spelling on that name? We had somebody
try it yesterday. Would <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. If you give me a pencil, I may try it.</p>

<p>(After writing name, as set out above, hands paper to Mr. Jenner.)</p>

<p>I think that's it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That spelling makes sense. I think that's probably an accurate
spelling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Her daughter still keeps this name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is her daughter's first name&mdash;the one you now have in
mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Christina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Christina. And she also had a child&mdash;Alexandra?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I don't know anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did De Mohrenschildt have a daughter by the name of Alexandra?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. De Mohrenschildt has two daughters, but I wouldn't know their
names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Though I met both girls, but I somehow slipped up. My wife
probably knows them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Christina Bogoiavlensky is a very good girl&mdash;and her husband,
too. They are quite different from the parents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. So, after that assignment in Yugoslavia, he had an assignment
in Ghana&mdash;which somehow puzzled us. First of all, it was a pretty
short assignment; secondly, that the thing is that he showed us a newspaper
edited in Ghana in which, on the first page, was a short article describing the
arrival of "this famous specialist in postal stamps&mdash;Mr. De Mohrenschildt, who
came to Ghana on business as a representative of a Swedish company."</p>

<p>Well, De Mohrenschildt, what he says about that, he says, "Oh, those jerks&mdash;they
don't know anything."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, excuse me. The newspaper account was to the effect that
De Mohrenschildt had come to Ghana as a representative of a Swedish company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, I don't know whether the word "Swedish," was in
there&mdash;but it said, "As a representative,"&mdash;and he said that it would be this
Swedish company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He said that it was a Swedish company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah. The newspaper may just had the name of the company,
you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But it did mention De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, yes. "George De Mohrenschildt, famous philatelist and
specialist in stamps"&mdash;and so on.</p>

<p>And I said, "George, since when do you understand anything in stamps?
Since when are you a specialist in postal stamps?"</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "I'm not; but, first of all, those jerks there, they don't know
the difference anyhow; besides that, that company also provides Ghana and
other African country with stamps, and it also has trades in different other commodities
and also has oil interests in Africa." So, he says, "I went there as
their representative to see what parts of the country they would lease there for,
you know, for oil leases and assign&mdash;and sign some kind of contract with them&mdash;with
the Government of Ghana&mdash;in their name, and came back to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then he returned to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah. And, later, he also referred that that company has interests
in Nigeria&mdash;and he says, "you know, I am Swedish&mdash;so they rely on me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
The whole thing puzzles us a little because I think there are many geologists
in Sweden itself&mdash;but perhaps they don't have oil specialists there. I think
there is no oil in Sweden.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you and the other members of the community think that he
was exaggerating or this was all fictional?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, I couldn't doubt when the newspaper says that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When the Ghana newspaper said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah. So he must have been in Ghana. He wouldn't print
that newspaper&mdash;I hope. But, of course, he is a man who exaggerates a lot.
He is that kind of character. I never believe 100 percent of whatever he was
talking, because he was always, you know, making talk much more than he actually
is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At least, he tended to exaggerate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; because he always posed everybody as a big shot, you
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Everybody with whom he was associated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes, are&mdash;or to whom he met&mdash;that he was a, you know, big
businessman, big oil man, and so on&mdash;big specialist. And he wrote an article
about himself in the Oil and Gas Journal about Yugoslavia, his trip to Yugoslavia,
and it was said that by knowledge of the State Department he was there;
and it was implied that he was actually in the Foreign Aid, you know, and
that he&mdash;and it was said, you know, like a little thing, you know, an explanation
he wrote about himself. You can get that Oil and Gas Journal. And it was
said that Mr. De Mohrenschildt is an internationally know specialist in oil, a
consultant to at least six different governments and so on. And there was&mdash;all
kind of countries were there, I don't know which ones but, of course,
Yugoslavia was mentioned there. And he tells about his trip to Yugoslavia and
he told everybody then after&mdash;when he came back from Yugoslavia he was
called to the State Department to give his opinion on the state of affairs in
Yugoslavia&mdash;"And I gave quite a lecture there to those boys there in the State
Department. They all sat down and listened to me." You know, that kind of
talk.</p>

<p>So, then he was in Ghana and I heard he was a second time in Ghana and a
second time in Yugoslavia&mdash;but I didn't hear it from him. I just heard that as
a rumor.</p>

<p>And then when he was in Yugoslavia, he also made a trip to Sweden, after
Yugoslavia, and from Sweden he went to Poland, to Warsaw. And, you know,
in Warsaw he went to high school and he had a lot of friends and relatives&mdash;so
he said he stayed there for a week, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was this? When did this take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In Poland, I think was 1958, because he was in 1957, 1958,
he was in Yugoslavia and after Yugoslavia I think he went to Sweden and from
Sweden he went to Warsaw to see relatives. He has cousins there. He said it
was very difficult for him because to get even the permission of the American
Government to go there and visit Poland, but he finally got it, and the Polish
visa he finally got that. And he went to see his relatives and friends for a
week. And he said that Warsaw made on him a very sad impression because
he said it was much more cheerful city before the war and he used to live
there. And, besides that, he made a lot of travels which we don't know. Of
course, one trip was his famous trip when he went by foot to Panama City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fix the time of that, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That was 1960, 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that at about the time of the Cuban invasion or the preparations
for the Cuban invasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I don't know. No. Cuban invasion was much later. You
mean our Cuban invasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't want to say it was our Cuban invasion&mdash;but there was
an invasion of Cuba.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, I take that from the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it about this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No, that was before that time, I would say, because it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
in 1960. We don't know when they left because we were not on speaking terms
at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had there come about a break in friendship with De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; but that was about the time when they left on their
trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were supposed to do what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. To go by foot from Torreon on to Panama City. This is a
city near the American border there and, as we were explained later by them,
they went to Torreon. They have a lot of friends on the border, you know.
There is particularly a very rich man there who is American married with a
Mexican girl&mdash;a very rich man living near Eagle Pass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Tito Harper, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Harper? Tito Harper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah; I think so. You can check it with my wife. I never
met him but I met his wife. They're very nice people, very rich people, big
businessman there on the border. They have, you know, business on both sides
of the border, and they are big friends of George.</p>

<p>And, from there, he went to Torreon&mdash;I don't know why Torreon&mdash;and I understand
that from there they started by foot to cross Old Mexico, Guatemala,
San Salvador, and all the countries throughout by foot&mdash;having a mule and on
the mule they had their, you know, their belongings, and a little mule and a
little dog, and the mule rode the dog&mdash;I mean, the dog rode the mule&mdash;and
that way they traveled, you know, badly dressed, through all those countries
for more than a year. In order not to be killed, you know, they dressed very
badly because it's dangerous. You know this already. They didn't go along the
main highways, they went through the back passes, you know, through all the
hills.</p>

<p>And they made a movie on their whole travel, which I saw. And, for example,
they climbed the volcano which was in action up to the top&mdash;which was erupting.
They made a movie of her standing from the lava flow as from here to the
door (indicating a few feet.) And he made the movie&mdash;it's real exciting&mdash;a
colored movie and that red lava flowing&mdash;you know, these people are very
adventurous and, of course, they enjoy doing things like that. I wouldn't climb
it.</p>

<p>And, so, they finally came to Panama City. And then from Panama City
they flew to Haiti where George had a very close friend&mdash;also a very rich
man there of Russian background on Haiti.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he mention his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. He's dead now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He's dead? Did he mention his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes, he was&mdash;I'm bad on names. His first name was Michel&mdash;which
is Michael, of course, and what the second name is, I don't know&mdash;Brightman.
He was a very old man who was a local businessman on Haiti, and he died
since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And as antireligious as they both were, they came to church
and ordered a church service for Brightman. That was the only time she was
in the church&mdash;because she's more antireligious than he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when you say "she," you mean Mrs. De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Mrs. De Mohrenschildt&mdash;yes. Because he's not religious, not
believing in God, but he's not fighting it. But <span class="locked">she&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He's not antagonistic to religion but she is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. She is. Yeah. But the only time she came&mdash;and she cried
in the church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, which church is this? Here in Dallas or in Haiti?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. When they came back, you see, from there, Brightman died
after&mdash;pretty soon, and they came to the church&mdash;which puzzled our pastor very
much, Father Royster&mdash;and they asked for a church service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They asked to have a mass said for the deceased Mr. Brightman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah. So, after that, when he came already he said he would
like to look for another assignment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Was there anything said when they came back, or
reports that when they were in Guatemala that they occupied a home there of
some people, I think, from Arizona&mdash;Hilton or Tilton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No&mdash;not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or a name of that character? And they stayed in Guatemala
while the Cuban refugees were being trained?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; I didn't hear about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't? All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. You see, they didn't write us from their trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. What we heard from their trip, we heard actually from Mr.
and Mrs. Ballen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. [Spelling] B-a-l-l-e-n&mdash;Sam Ballen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Sam Ballen is a friend of theirs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Sam Ballen was then a friend of theirs and Sam Ballen was a
friend of the boss, Mr. Rogatz, my wife's boss. That's how we came to know
Mr. Ballen, through Mr. Rogatz. Mr. Ballen was there almost every day in
Rogatz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But Ballen was a particular friend of De Mohrenschildt; is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; I would say so. Ballen had some kind of admiration of
George&mdash;which I can't share too well. I think George is a very interesting
fellow, I enjoyed talking with him&mdash;taking, of course, 30 or 40 percent off of
what he says. But still the rest of it was always interesting because, you know,
a man who travels, always travels, always tells something interesting about
the country. And George had a certain talent of observation.</p>

<p>You know, he is writing a book about his travels to Panama and he has it
written day by day; and now he wants to sell this book. He read us a few
pages from that book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Is that George Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; George De Mohrenschildt. George Bouhe is an unusually
dumb person. And then he finally got this Haiti assignment, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he left Dallas for the Haiti assignment when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, somewhere in the spring last year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he tell you about that assignment, if he told you
anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, he showed us a newspaper again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. From Haiti.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And to what effect was the article in the paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. It was more than a page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. More than a page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. It may&mdash;it was more than a page and it was the official newspaper
of the Government of Haiti&mdash;which was a contract between the Government
of Haiti and George De Mohrenschildt Co., Inc.&mdash;not George De Mohrenschildt
himself&mdash;to make a magnetic survey of Haiti for the sum of&mdash;I don't
remember exactly&mdash;about $300,000; in which it said that Mr. De Mohrenschildt's
company will, according to specification, make a magnetic survey and also
work on discoveries of minerals&mdash;oil and other minerals.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Haiti?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. For the country of Haiti&mdash;and I think the contract is for
2 years.</p>

<p>I also saw another newspaper, which she showed to everybody&mdash;Mrs. De
Mohrenschildt&mdash;in which it was said that a contract was signed between our
country and Mr. De Mohrenschildt's company and Mr. De Mohrenschildt is an
American businessman who is just visiting now our country with his wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
wife. And she liked that, of course. And it was few more words written about
how wonderful she was&mdash;so she told&mdash;showed it to everybody. Well, that's only
human&mdash;"They say I'm a wonderful woman!"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These two newspaper accounts were shown to you by the De
Mohrenschildts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. While they were here in Dallas before they left for Haiti?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; they were in Haiti before they finally left there. It was
on a short trip to sign the contract.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They took at least one or more short trips to <span class="locked">Haiti&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Until they had these contracts signed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then they left permanently for 2 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was in the spring of 1963, that they left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In that interim period preceding their leaving is when you saw
the newspaper <span class="locked">account&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Printed in the Haiti paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah&mdash;in French.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In French?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which you and your wife, and others in this community we've
been talking about, saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well&mdash;after they left, that's it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's it. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And since then, we have received, I think, a short card from
them and the Christmas greeting&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's about all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's about all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, when they made the trip from the United
States-Mexican border to Panama, was there anything said to you by them,
or was it the reputation in the area, about something about their meeting
Mikoyan when they were on that trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, this was before that trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was? Tell us about that, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, they made a trip before that trip by foot&mdash;they made a
trip to Mexico City and back, just a short trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was by more conventional means of transportation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; yes. That was either by car or by plane. I don't know.
I think they mostly traveled by car.</p>

<p>I know that they went to New York and they came back from New York
and then went to Mexico City and then came back to Dallas.</p>

<p>And we heard&mdash;I don't know from whom we heard&mdash;that they met Mikoyan.
I imagine we heard that from the Ballens. I think&mdash;I imagine so. But then
I asked her about that, because I didn't like it, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't like the fact that they had met Mikoyan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah. I wouldn't meet Mikoyan&mdash;being a top Communist&mdash;Mr.
Mikoyan is a top Communist and a butcher of the Stalin times. So, whatever
he talks now, I wouldn't meet him anyhow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, you wouldn't have anything to do with Mikoyan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No, sir; so, I asked her what is the whole story about? And
she told me that it was just meant as a joke&mdash;namely that at that time there was
a Soviet exhibition of some <span class="locked">kind&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Mexico City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In Mexico City. And that's why Mikoyan was present there.
And one day&mdash;and she said Mikoyan was always guarded by Mexican security<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
and Soviet security&mdash;and it was one moment he was televised&mdash;you know, when
he was televised&mdash;she just jumped out of the crowd through the security men,
you know, and said, "Hello, hello, Mr. Mikoyan. What are you doing?"</p>

<p>And she said, "He was terribly embarrassed and afraid perhaps I'll kill him."</p>

<p>But, so, he said, "Who are you?"</p>

<p>And she said, "I'm a Russian living in America."</p>

<p>And he asked, "What you want?"</p>

<p>And she said then the security agent came and asked her to leave&mdash;and she
left.</p>

<p>So, she says that's all that it was&mdash;she said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Because, you know, I wanted to make sure of what the thing
is about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You wanted to know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah. I wanted to know from her&mdash;because if she would
go, you know, make some deals with Mikoyan, then I wouldn't like to talk with
her at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. But a joke&mdash;well De Mohrenschildt and his wife&mdash;they are
peculiar people, always doing something which nobody else does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were they unconventional people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. They are the most unconventional people I ever have seen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are they unconventional in dress as well as in habits and
things they do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, yes; oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us a little about the unconventionality of dress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, for example, she always goes around in trousers, a
very tight trouser, with some kind of a tight bosom top, you know, trying to
imitate, you know, 15-year teenager girls, you know. And he goes out very
often without a tie or open breast&mdash;completely open breast. And he may drop
in somebody's party in this state&mdash;and without shoes, you know. He may do
things like that. Another time, you may see him perfectly dressed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He's unpredictable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. He is absolutely unpredictable&mdash;and I think even he knows he's
unpredictable, because I understand he even had a psychiatrist to whom he
went. My wife told me about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From all this, do you have an impression of the De Mohrenschildts&mdash;either
one of them&mdash;as to their possible connection with any Communist
or agencies, Party, or what not? Or do you think they are just extraordinarily
unconventional? In other words, do you think it's deeper than the lack of
conventionality?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. It may be; it may not be. I'm not&mdash;you know, now all of us
are looking back and trying to talk it over and find one way or the other.
This is a thing which, you know, is discussed at all times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You're rationalizing at the moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. We are rationalizing&mdash;all of us&mdash;at that moment. Of course,
we do not have any proof whatever one way or the other.</p>

<p>I can tell you what she told us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. She told us that her first husband was a former Communist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Her first husband was <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Bogoiavlensky.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Who is now in a mental institution in California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that he was a Communist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; in his young days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, when you say "Communist"&mdash;an active member of the
Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I think of the Communist Youth Organization. Because it
was not in Soviet Russia; it was in China.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. But of some kind&mdash;I don't know what the official name of the
organization may be&mdash;but it was some kind of Communist Youth Organization.</p>

<p>So she said when she married him that the situation what it was and they
did not want to stay in China and they debated the question of whether to go to
Soviet Russia or to go to United States. And she said that it's her influence
was to break up&mdash;that he break up all his ties with the Communists. And come
to the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was her desire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. She said that was her desire. And she said that's what her
first husband did&mdash;that they broke off with the Communists and come over to
the United States. And she said, "Since then, neither my husband or me have
anything to do with the Communist Party."</p>

<p>That's her story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. On the other hand, she was always praising the Chinese
Communist regime&mdash;because she was saying that they do a lot of good developing
her beloved native country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. China?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. China.</p>

<p>When she said&mdash;mentioned that in my presence, I said, "This is pure Communist
propaganda. You should know better than tell that."</p>

<p>On this she repeated very, you know angrily, she say, "You should not tell
me that I spread Communist propaganda&mdash;because they shot my father."</p>

<p>That's what she said.</p>

<p>But that argument of whether the Communists do anything positive for China
or not was, you know, coming back and back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Repeated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Repeatedly when we met. And sometimes, especially my
wife and her were so angry with each other that we wouldn't talk with them,
you know, for several months. But somehow you meet these people again
somewhere in the same social circle, then you talk to them again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was a violent difference of opinion between your wife and
Mrs. De Mohrenschildt on this subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. On this subject.</p>

<p>But where the Russian Communists are concerned, she always said that they
are too nationalistic for her. She doesn't like&mdash;she didn't like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Mrs. De Mohrenschildt didn't like that.</p>

<p>She said, "I don't like anything about Russia." She didn't like Russian
music, she wouldn't stand a record in Russian language, or even anybody,
you know, whistling a Russian tune. She would get so angry I don't know what.</p>

<p>And she would say, "I am against nationalism of any kind. I am for the
world government." She was very much for the world government, you know,
and things like that&mdash;international institutions and&mdash;uh; but, on the other
hand, when you start, you know, pressing her against the wall, you say, "Well,
stop that. That's kind of communistic talk,"&mdash;she would immediately bring into
the thing that "They killed my poor father. I just want to be objective, you
know, and say what's bad, what's good." And she said, "you are all one-sided
reactionaries," and so on, and "what do you think?" "I would praise the killers
of my father?" And so on. "I just want to be objective."</p>

<p>Well, you know, I don't like to argue with, you know, too much with women;
so I just stay away from that argument. But my wife will probably tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, did you become acquainted at any <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. May I say something in addition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Because that's what I said about her.</p>

<p>What his concern&mdash;I never heard about him praising Chinese or Russian
Communists but he was praising the Yugoslav Communists. He was there
and he came there and he was very enthusiastic about what the wonderful
things they are doing. You know, I lived in Yugoslavia myself and I tried to
explain him that this country was pretty good country before and there
was nothing just to save it from.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. But, of course, he didn't see it and he was very enthusiastic
and&mdash;about mountains and so on. I tried to persuade him they were there before,
you know, that they were wonderful before&mdash;and that Communists did
not build them&mdash;but he would somehow always, was always enthusiastic about
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About Yugoslavia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. About Yugoslavia and the Yugoslavia regime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And its regime as well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Its regime as well. That's true.</p>

<p>About China, he said he doesn't know anything; he'll let his wife talk.</p>

<p>So, anyhow, these people are, of course, leftist people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The De Mohrenschildts are leftists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah. But she much more than him. Because he was, on
the other hand, boasting, you know, that he never voted for a Democrat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He had never voted for a Democrat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah. He was always an Eisenhower man, a Republican&mdash;and
they argued between themselves the whole time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is Mr. and Mrs. De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, yes. And the way they argued on politics among themselves&mdash;because
she was somehow bitterly left, and he sometimes tried to, you
know, get her be a little more objective.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Induce her to be a little more objective?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah. But she was always bitterly to the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever meet either Lee or Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No, sir; thank God!</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did a time come when you heard about Lee or Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us the circumstances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I read in the newspaper, Dallas Herald, about them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, when they came to this country. There was a short
article about an American defector to the Communists, that he finally came
back with a Russian wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was in June of 1962&mdash;just to orient you. You saw that
item in the newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it a subject of discussion in the community among the
people you've told us about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; not in the beginning. Except that we heard&mdash;we visited
Mr. and Mrs. Clark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that Mr. and Mrs. Max Clark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. An attorney in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In Fort Worth. And she is of Russian descent, as you know;
and they told us that they met this couple which came from Soviet Russia and
they didn't like them. And they said he was very unpleasant and bitter fellow&mdash;and
they wouldn't like to see him again&mdash;something like that. So, we decided
already there that we wouldn't like to meet them either, you know&mdash;and especially,
you know, you don't like any kind of defector, you know, or any kind
of unpleasant, "bummish" people, you know. That's a Dallas expression.
That's polite for bum&mdash;as he was described to us. He&mdash;Oswald.</p>

<p>So, later, we heard that Mr. Bouhe, of course, in lack of other prospects for
help, started helping the Oswald family. But as far as our relations with
Bouhe nowadays, already for many years, are just very, very occasional;
we had no direct contact with him except we really need something, you know,
an address or some information of that kind. So, Bouhe wouldn't bring them
to us. He knows that&mdash;better than bringing to us anybody.</p>

<p>But, as I understand, the De Mohrenschildts met with the Oswalds and the
De Mohrenschildts told us that there are two poor, very poor and young people
here, Mr. and Mrs. Oswald, and they need help and she has a toothache and
they are bringing her to the dentist, and so on&mdash;they don't have a penny and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
nobody gives them a job, and things like that. And "would you like to meet
them?"</p>

<p>Well, after reading, you know, what we read and after hearing from Clarks,
who these people are, I say, "No, George; I don't like to meet him." And
my wife said, "Oh, no; we don't like to meet with that kind of people."</p>

<p>So, I said that very insistently&mdash;so the De Mohrenschildts knew better
than acquaint us. So, never we met them. Of course, it could have happened,
you know, if we would have just dropped in sometime. There was always a
possibility of that kind. But, thank <span class="locked">God&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But it never happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. It never happened. So, we always were hearing about them
from De Mohrenschildts and other people but we never met them actually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had the impression, did you not&mdash;or did you&mdash;that the De
Mohrenschildts saw the Oswalds frequently and were attempting to assist
them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; he was&mdash;only one time he was very bitter about Oswald
when he beat up his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, once we saw De Mohrenschildt and his wife and he
said, "Well, he doesn't behave like he should. What does he think he is, beating
his wife?" But Mrs. De Mohrenschildt said, "Well, don't just judge people
without knowing what's behind them." She said, "You always, George, you
jump to conclusions. We don't know what happened."</p>

<p>I understand that she liked Lee much more than he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That Mrs. De Mohrenschildt liked Lee much more than George
did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>This fellow De Mohrenschildt, was he a type of person to provoke arguments?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, yes; he liked that. Yes; sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Describe him physically. Is he a handsome man? A big man?
Athletic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; he is a big, athletic man, a permanent tennis player&mdash;always
played tennis and liked all kinds of sports, you know; and he would
go to the ice arena there in the Fair Park, you know. And he devoted always
a lot of time to <span class="locked">sports&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was Mrs. De <span class="locked">Mohrenschildt&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And she tried to do it, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. What else can I tell you?</p>

<p>Well, I know that he&mdash;the way he talks, you know, he talks for and against
anything. You know, probably, about his famous lecture in the Bohemian Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I'll get that in a minute. Did you say that he was argumentatively
inclined so he would take the opposite side of any argument?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah, he was usually taking the opposite side of whatever
anybody would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; and was he provocative in his argumentation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; and I think he enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was extreme in his argumentation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah; that was his famous lecture, of course, which was some
kind of a thing which was talked very much in Dallas about when he made a
lecture in the Bohemian Club.</p>

<p>The Bohemian Club is a group of about 30 people&mdash;Dallasites&mdash;who like to
argue. And he was the soul of the whole thing. And you know probably
who is in there. It's Sam Ballen, and L-e-v A-r-o-n-s-o-n [spelling], Bill Hudson&mdash;I
don't know, a lot of other people I have never met.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you a member of the Bohemian Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; I was not. But I was invited by George to go to the
Bohemian Club. He will give a historical lecture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were present on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I was present on that occasion.</p>

<p>And George discussed the question, you know, about the Vlassov army. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
was an army composed of Russian&mdash;Soviet Russian prisoners of war who wanted
to fight the Communists.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the name of this army?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Vlassov [spelling] V-l-a-s-s-o-v.</p>

<p>And he told the story of the Vlassov army but, in between, he injected a lot
of praise for such people like Himmler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Heinrich Himmler?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Heinrich Himmler. He said, "After all, I came to the conclusion
that Himmler wasn't a bad boy at all."</p>

<p>You know, that's typically George.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you think that this was sincere or do you think that he
was just attempting to provoke shock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I think he was attempting to provoke shock. Especially there
were, at least, three Jewish people there present&mdash;Sam Ballen and Lev Aronson.
I saw that Lev Aronson almost didn't&mdash;was, became red, terribly red in his
face. I was afraid that the poor guy, you know, would have a stroke, You
know. And George was looking into the face of Aronson and, you know, continued
praising the Nazis and look what effect it has on Lev, who is a close
friend of George. Of course, Lev was terribly bitter&mdash;and I understand, after
that, Lev and him went to drink vodka the whole night. So, well&mdash;that's the
type of person you have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, Mr. Voshinin, I think my questioning is about
concluded, but I do want to ask this general question in any event. Is there
anything you think factually that hasn't been brought out that occurs to you
that might be of assistance to the Commission in its investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you state it, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I think, first of all, there are persons which you did not
question and which knows De Mohrenschildt, I think, much better than I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. For example, Mr. Basil Zavoico.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now give us that full name and spell it, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. [Spelling] B-a-s-i-l&mdash;that's the first name. Second is
Z-a-v-o-i-c-o&mdash;or k-o&mdash;I don't know. And he lived in Texas before and he's living
now in Green Farms, Conn., his house being called Cronomere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Spell that, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. [Spelling] C-r-o-n-o-m-e-r-e. And why I know Mr. Zavoico
because his wife lived in Yugoslavia before the war and me and my wife we
were close friends with her. And I think that Mr. Zavoico knows George De
Mohrenschildt many years before we did, and he once even warned us against
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Warned you against De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; he said, "Don't be too close with De Mohrenschildt," he
said, "because, who knows what he is?" He says, "He sometimes talks so much
to the left, I'm not sure what he is."</p>

<p>And I think that he knows a lot about his life before the time we came here.
I think in that time there will be a lot of things to your interest.</p>

<p>I don't know whether you questioned another person&mdash;it's Mr. Paul
Raigorodsky.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You've mentioned him before&mdash;at the first of this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; because Paul Raigorodsky is the first Russian immigrant
that&mdash;whoever came to Dallas. And he knows absolutely everybody and he
knows these people much longer time than we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And he knows George pretty closely. He also lived in the
Stoneleigh Hotel&mdash;and still living there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah. And he saw George every day where we saw him only
occasionally. A third person which I would suggest would be Mrs. Graff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. [Spelling] G-r-a-f-f?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; Mrs. Theodore Graff&mdash;who worked for George as a secretary
mostly in the time that George was in Yugoslavia. He still was, one part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
of the time, maintaining his office in the Republic Bank, and Mrs. Graff worked
there. And I think that Mrs. Graff knows a lot about De Mohrenschildt's business.
You see, my wife only worked there 2 or 3 weeks so she doesn't know
much. But I understand that Mrs. Graff was there and she read a lot of his
files, you know, sorting them and having no other things to do. Especially, I
think that George had written his autobiography and she has seen it. I understand
she has seen it. It is some kind of a novel about himself which he wanted
to sell.</p>

<p>Then, I think you should also question a Mrs. Leslie and Miss Leslie who
know him. Mrs. Leslie and her stepdaughter, Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are they residents of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. They are residents of Dallas. Yeah. Mrs. Graff is now living
in Birmingham&mdash;you know, near Detroit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, yes; I know. It's a suburb of Detroit. My daughter attended
school in Birmingham.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Mrs. Graff is from Connecticut otherwise, but she was here
with her husband. He was working here in Republic Bank&mdash;and that's where
George's office was. She was at one time, you know, his secretary&mdash;part-time,
I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where do Mrs. Leslie and Miss Leslie live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Mrs. Leslie and Miss Leslie on Hanover.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Hanover Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; Hanover Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes; they are Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. But Miss Leslie's father was of British descent&mdash;but his wife
was Russian. And I think these people, they don't know much about the De
Mohrenschildts, but it's also from the same circle, you know, and all that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They may know something about the Oswalds, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I don't know. I don't know one way or the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But they moved in this circle that you've described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. They moved in that circle. Now, there is one thing which
always strikes me peculiar&mdash;I just talked last night with my wife about that.
The last 2 years, you know, the De Mohrenschildts were going to Houston about
every 4 weeks, and De Mohrenschildt was always saying, "I have to go to
Houston on business." And he would say&mdash;of course, you don't ask people,
you know. George didn't like to talk about what his business is you know.
Never told anybody about the details and nobody, of course, asked him.</p>

<p>And he would say, "You know, I have to go&mdash;you know, all my business goes
through Houston." On the other hand, he would say he was, you know, getting
his jobs through a 5 percenter in Washington&mdash;and here he was always going
to Houston, like reporting to somebody; every 4 or 5 weeks, he was always going
to Houston. And as far as me and my wife heard about his business, he has
no oil interest there or no business there whatsoever. But as far as he was
always interested only in foreign assignments, why should he go to Houston?
In other words, even before, you know, the late President was killed, you know,
we were once talking this with my wife and wondering&mdash;what in the hell is he
doing in Houston?</p>

<p>You don't get foreign assignments through Houston&mdash;not that we know about,
but always he was going to Houston. And, I don't know, he never mentioned
to who he goes to Houston. But, it may be possible that I can give you a name
of a Russian professor in Houston who may know&mdash;may not know but may
know&mdash;who knows something because Professor <span class="locked">Jitkoff&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Spell it, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. [Spelling] J-i-t-k-o-f-f.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And at what institution is he a professor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Rice Institute. The head of the department of the Rice Institute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. The Russian Department. He can't stand George De Mohrenschildt.
And I know about De Mohrenschildt being in Houston&mdash;I know, that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
too, from Professor Jitkoff, which is a very, very respectable family man, a very
respectable anti-Communist. As anti-Communist as could be, you know. And
they told us several times that George and Jeanne dropped in&mdash;which is not her
name. Her name is Eugenia. But, you know she's French. That's her baptized
name, you see.</p>

<p>But they may know perhaps with whom they are associated in Houston.
There is a vague possibility of that&mdash;because that always sounded peculiar to
us, that Houston trips. Well, I think these people they live on Locke Lane
[spelling] L-o-c-k-e&mdash;in Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, we can reach him if he is a professor at Rice Institute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah. And they knew the De Mohrenschildts, of course, before
we ever came here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anything else occur to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, I also heard from her that she wanted to sell her fashions
to the Soviets. And that they went to New York to the Soviet consulate and
she was asking whether they can sell any fashions to them&mdash;but, as I understand,
they say they turned them down, they are not interested. And that was
just before their trip to Mexico City. So, there is a slight possibility&mdash;but this
is just speculation on my part&mdash;that they probably tried the Soviet consulate in
Mexico City also to sell them some fashions&mdash;though I don't know, but this is
possible, you know. You know, most of the Russian immigrants, like us, you
know, wouldn't deal with the Soviets at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You just don't want any part of them at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. We don't want any part of it. Our only dealings, you know,
is going there to buy dictionaries&mdash;you know, and things like that. And that
we would prefer not to do in the Soviet store in New York, but rather through
an immigrant store who buys it from them, you know. But the De Mohrenschildts
they wouldn't have any hesitation, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of going directly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Of going directly to deal with all of them, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like to ask you about the Houston trips. Did the Houston
trips take place during the years 1962 and 1963, up to the <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Up to their departure. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Up to the time the De Mohrenschildts left for Haiti?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is your distinct recollection, which we can confirm, of
course, or try to, that these periodic 4- to 5-week trips&mdash;a trip every 4 or 5 weeks
to Houston, took place in 1962 and 1963, to the time they left, and even might
have been prior to 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, yeah, they may; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you and your wife become quite conscious of the
fact that the De Mohrenschildts were making periodic trips to Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. After Professor Jitkoff started complaining that the De
Mohrenschildts became a nuisance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. And that was when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And then we started recollecting about the De Mohrenschildts
telling, "Oh, we have to go on business to Houston." So, that probably was
late 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. You see, we go to Houston usually two times a year to visit
the Jitkoffs who are dear friends of ours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall whether or not these trips to Houston were being
made in September of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. In September of 1963, they were not here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, they weren't here then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; they left&mdash;I don't know which month they left for Haiti&mdash;but
I think they left way before September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Do you know whether either of the De Mohrenschildts
had been in this country since they left Dallas in the spring of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't know whether they have or haven't been?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I have no knowledge, no; no information about it. And I
have seen, you know, Christina and her husband. You know who they are&mdash;Kirken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Spell it, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Or whatever he calls himself&mdash;that's Mrs. De Mohrenschildt's
daughter and her husband. He calls himself Kirken. K-i-r-k-e-n [phonetic];
Americans call him <i>Kirten</i> [phonetic].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. [Spelling] K-a-r-t-o-n?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. [Spelling] K-i-r-k-e-n&mdash;or o-n&mdash;I don't know. They dropped in
when they came from Haiti.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were here recently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. They were here recently. They dropped by our house and
they said they are on bad terms with the parents and he said they left&mdash;they
couldn't stand that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did either of them say anything about whether or not George
De Mohrenschildt had made any statements to the effect that the FBI was
responsible for the assassination of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Oh, I heard that story; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From whom did you hear it? And give us your recollection of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I think that&mdash;uh&mdash;well, I heard it from my wife, to tell the
truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I'll talk to her about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And she heard it, I don't know, from the Ballens, maybe&mdash;or
maybe from the children.</p>

<p>I don't know. I think that Kirken said that George is behaving ridiculously
and he said, "My father-in-law is behaving ridiculously&mdash;he talks nonsense."
And he says, "We just decided to shorten our stay there because, otherwise, it
would come to very unpleasant scenes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was of the opinion that these fulminations or statements by
George De Mohrenschildt were nonsense?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Sure. George talks, you know, a lot of nonsense usually about
anything; but sometimes, you know, as Kirken says, he says he became quite
unpleasant with his nonsense and he says he couldn't stand it. And Kirken
and his wife are, I think, good Americans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. They are okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, is there anything else that occurs to you that you would
like to add in the record that you think might be helpful or pertinent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, not that I know at the present time, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If you think of anything, we're going to be back next week and
the week <span class="locked">afterwards&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Could you give me a telephone or anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you just call the U.S. attorney's office here and somebody
representing the Commission will be here. Either I will or some other person.
So all you have to do is ask for the U.S. attorney, Mr. Sanders&mdash;Barefoot
<span class="locked">Sanders&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah; I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he will know, and he will put you in touch with one of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Okay. Probably my wife will recollect a lot of things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now we've had some discussions off the record, is there anything
we discussed off the record that I have failed to bring out that you think ought
to be on the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Of what, for example?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there anything we discussed that I failed then to ask you
about so it would get on this transcript that the reporter is making?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Not that I know, unless you recall something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there anything which was stated by <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. You know De Mohrenschildt has here a brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, yes. His brother&mdash;he's a professor, according to your information
where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Dartmouth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At Dartmouth College?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yeah. I think he's perfectly okay&mdash;a very serious person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, you know his three wives&mdash;his former wives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I've asked you about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, his first wife, I think lives in Paris.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. And his second wife, I think, was a dancer or an artist of
some kind; his third wife was a medical doctor and now his fourth wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And his fourth wife is his present wife, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Yes. I think he has a litigation going the whole time about
seeing his little daughter, who is very sick. And I think the judge forebade
him to see her. That's the rumor I heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Well, I don't know. You ask&mdash;perhaps you <span class="locked">have&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have exhausted myself at the moment. These suggestions you
have given me may provoke my having you come back and, if we do, I'll let
you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Will you write my telephone number perhaps? Or, I'm just
across the street you can call me any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What we usually do is to have the Secret Service call you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. They're in the same building&mdash;two floors higher than me. They
can just call me up two stories up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. We'll close this deposition now.</p>

<p>You have the right, Mr. Voshinin, to read your testimony when it's typed up,
if you wish to do so. Perhaps there might be, when you read it over, something
you either wish to add or something you want to modify in some fashion or
other. It takes time to write these up. This young lady has been busy every
minute. We would hope to have this perhaps written up during the course of
the next week.</p>

<p>If you will call in&mdash;and also talk to Mr. Sanders&mdash;he will know when, and
when your transcript is ready it will be available to you for examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. Can I take it home and read it or do I have to come here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No. You may take it home only in this sense. You have the
right to purchase a copy of the transcript from this young lady at whatever
her usual rates are, if you want a copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. I think I would like a copy and put it with my pictures and
for my records to have at home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. You make arrangements with this young lady.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Voshinin</span>. My wife will make an arrangement on that. Okay&mdash;and if
there is any way I can help, please&mdash;I'd just tell everything I know without
any hesitation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I tried to pick your brain for everything I could think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We do appreciate it&mdash;and thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Punctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant

<p>Some simple typographical errors were corrected.</p>

<p>Inconsistent hyphenation of compound words retained.</p>

<p>Ambiguous end-of-line hyphens retained.</p>

<p>Occasional uses of "Mr." for "Mrs." and of "Mrs." for "Mr." corrected.</p>

<p>Dubious repeated words, (e.g., "What took place by way of of

<p>Several unbalanced quotation marks not remedied.</p>

<p>Occasional periods that should be question marks not changed.</p>

<p>Occasional periods that should be commas, and commas that should be
periods, were changed only when they clearly had been misprinted (at
the end of a paragraph or following a speaker's name in small-caps at
the beginning of a line). Some commas and semi-colons were printed so
faintly that they appear to be periods or colons: some were found and
corrected, but some almost certainly remain.</p>

<p>Text in quotations is not indented unless it was indented in the source.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_48">48</a>: "Mrs. Evans. Well, she might have finally got him in" did not show
"Evans" in small caps to indicate she was the speaker; corrected here.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_214">214</a>: "Executive Order No. 1130" should be "11130".</p>

"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bates</span>. I am Albert E. Jenner" with "<span class="smcap">Bates</span>" in small-caps, followed
by a period, indicating that Mrs. Bates was the speaker. Changed here.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_333">333</a>: "some of em he wouldn't" appears to be missing an apostrophe
